RDI is designed to support apps that must use a disk-based database as the system of record
but must also be fast and scalable. This is a common requirement for mobile and web
apps with a rapidly-growing number of users; the performance of the main database is fine at first
but it will soon struggle to handle the increasing demand without a cache.
