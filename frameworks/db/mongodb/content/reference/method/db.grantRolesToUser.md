# db.grantRolesToUser() (mongosh method)

## Definition

## Compatibility

This method is available in deployments hosted in the following environments:

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-no-atlas-support.rst

.. include:: /includes/fact-environments-onprem-only.rst

## Behavior

### Replica set

.. include:: /includes/fact-management-methods-write-concern.rst

## Required Access

.. include:: /includes/access-grant-roles.rst

## Example

Given a user `accountUser01` in the `products` database with the following roles:

```javascript
"roles" : [
    { "role" : "assetsReader",
      "db" : "assets"
    }
]
```

The following :method:`db.grantRolesToUser()` operation gives `accountUser01` the :authrole:`readWrite` role on the `products` database and the :authrole:`read` role on the `stock` database.

```javascript
use products
db.grantRolesToUser(
   "accountUser01",
   [ "readWrite" , { role: "read", db: "stock" } ],
   { w: "majority" , wtimeout: 4000 }
)
```

The user `accountUser01` in the `products` database now has the following roles:

```javascript
"roles" : [
    { "role" : "assetsReader",
      "db" : "assets"
    },
    { "role" : "read",
      "db" : "stock"
    },
    { "role" : "readWrite",
      "db" : "products"
    }
]
```
