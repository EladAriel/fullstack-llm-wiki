In MongoDB 8.2.0, |collectionUUID-link| and |disambiguatedPaths-link| are included in applicable change events even if you do not set `showExpandedEvents`. In MongoDB versions earlier than 8.2.0 and in versions 8.2.1 and later, these fields are included only if you open the change stream with `showExpandedEvents: true`.
