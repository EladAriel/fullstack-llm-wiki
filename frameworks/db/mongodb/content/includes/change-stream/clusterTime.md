`clusterTime` is the timestamp from the oplog entry associated with the event.

Due to `oplog size limits<txn-oplog-size-limit>`, `multi-document transactions <transactions>` may create multiple oplog entries. In a transaction, change stream events staged in a given oplog entry share the same `clusterTime`.

Events with the same `clusterTime` may not all relate to the same transaction. Some events don't relate to a transaction at all. Starting in MongoDB 8.0, this may be true for events on any deployment. In previous versions, this behavior was possible only for events on a sharded cluster.

To identify events for a single transaction, you can use the combination of `lsid` and `txnNumber` in the change stream event document.
