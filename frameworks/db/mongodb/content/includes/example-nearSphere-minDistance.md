Consider a collection `places` that contains documents with a `location` field and has a `2dsphere <2dsphere-index>` index.

Then, the following example returns whose `location` is at least `1000` meters from and at most `5000` meters from the specified point, ordered from nearest to farthest:

```javascript
db.places.find(
   {
     location: {
        $nearSphere: {
           $geometry: {
              type : "Point",
              coordinates : [ -73.9667, 40.78 ]
           },
           $minDistance: 1000,
           $maxDistance: 5000
        }
     }
   }
)
```
