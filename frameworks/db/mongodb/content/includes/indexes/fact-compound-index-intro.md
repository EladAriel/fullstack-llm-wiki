Compound indexes collect and sort data from multiple field values from each document in a collection. You can use the compound index to query the first field or any prefix fields of the index. The order of fields in a compound index is very important. The B-tree created by a compound index stores the sorted data in the order that the index specifies the fields.

For example, the following image shows a compound index where documents are first sorted by `userid` in ascending order (alphabetically). Then, the `scores` for each `userid` are sorted in descending order:
