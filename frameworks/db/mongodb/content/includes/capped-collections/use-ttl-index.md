Generally, `TTL (Time To Live) indexes <index-feature-ttl>` offer better performance and more flexibility than capped collections. TTL indexes expire and remove data from normal collections based on the value of a date-typed field and a TTL value for the index.

Capped collections serialize write operations and therefore have worse concurrent insert, update, and delete performance than non-capped collections. Before you create a capped collection, consider if you can use a TTL index instead.
