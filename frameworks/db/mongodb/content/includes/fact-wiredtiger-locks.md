For most read and write operations, WiredTiger uses optimistic concurrency control. WiredTiger uses only intent locks at the global, database and collection levels. When the storage engine detects conflicts between two operations, one will incur a write conflict causing MongoDB to transparently retry that operation.

Some global operations, typically short lived operations involving multiple databases, still require a global "instance-wide" lock. Some other operations, such as :dbcommand:`renameCollection`, still require an exclusive database lock in certain circumstances.
