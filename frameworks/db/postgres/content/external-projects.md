# External Projects

  
   PostgreSQL is a complex software project,
   and managing the project is difficult. We have found that many
   enhancements to PostgreSQL can be more
   efficiently developed separately from the core project.
  

 
# Client Interfaces

  
   interfaces
   externally maintained
  

  
   There are only two client interfaces included in the base
   PostgreSQL distribution:
   
    
     
      libpq is included because it is the
      primary C language interface, and because many other client interfaces
      are built on top of it.
     
    

    
     
      ECPG is included because it depends on the
      server-side SQL grammar, and is therefore sensitive to changes in
      PostgreSQL itself.
     
    
   

   All other language interfaces are external projects and are distributed
   separately. A
   list of language interfaces
   is maintained on the PostgreSQL wiki. Note that some of these packages are
   not released under the same license as PostgreSQL.
   For more information on each language interface, including licensing terms,
   refer to its website and documentation.

 
# Administration Tools

  
   administration tools
   externally maintained
  

  
   There are several administration tools available for
   PostgreSQL. The most popular is
   pgAdmin,
   and there are several commercially available ones as well.

 
# Procedural Languages

  
   procedural language
   externally maintained
  

  
   PostgreSQL includes several procedural
   languages with the base distribution: PL/pgSQL, PL/Tcl,
   PL/Perl, and PL/Python.
  

  
   In addition, there are a number of procedural languages that are developed
   and maintained outside the core PostgreSQL
   distribution. A list of
   procedural languages
   is maintained on the PostgreSQL wiki. Note that some of these projects are
   not released under the same license as PostgreSQL.
   For more information on each procedural language, including licensing
   information, refer to its website
   and documentation.

 
# Extensions

  
   extension
   externally maintained
  

  
   PostgreSQL is designed to be easily extensible. For
   this reason, extensions loaded into the database can function
   just like features that are built in. The
   contrib/ directory shipped with the source code
   contains several extensions, which are described in
   .  Other extensions are developed
   independently, like PostGIS.  Even
   PostgreSQL replication solutions can be developed
   externally. For example,  Slony-I is a popular
   primary/standby replication solution that is developed independently
   from the core project.
