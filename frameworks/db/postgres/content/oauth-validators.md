## OAuth Validator Modules

OAuth Validators

PostgreSQL provides infrastructure for creating custom modules to perform server-side validation of OAuth bearer tokens. Because OAuth implementations vary so wildly, and bearer token validation is heavily dependent on the issuing party, the server cannot check the token itself; validator modules provide the integration layer between the server and the OAuth provider in use.

OAuth validator modules must at least consist of an initialization function (see `oauth-validator-init`) and the required callback for performing validation (see `oauth-validator-callback-validate`).

Since a misbehaving validator might let unauthorized users into the database, correct implementation is crucial for server safety. See `oauth-validator-design` for design considerations.

## Safely Designing a Validator Module

Read and understand the entirety of this section before implementing a validator module. A malfunctioning validator is potentially worse than no authentication at all, both because of the false sense of security it provides, and because it may contribute to attacks against other pieces of an OAuth ecosystem.

## Validator Responsibilities

Although different modules may take very different approaches to token validation, implementations generally need to perform three separate actions:

- The validator must first ensure that the presented token is in fact a valid Bearer token for use in client authentication. The correct way to do this depends on the provider, but it generally involves either cryptographic operations to prove that the token was created by a trusted party (offline validation), or the presentation of the token to that trusted party so that it can perform validation for you (online validation). Online validation, usually implemented via [OAuth Token Introspection](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7662), requires fewer steps of a validator module and allows central revocation of a token in the event that it is stolen or misissued. However, it does require the module to make at least one network call per authentication attempt (all of which must complete within the configured `guc-authentication-timeout`). Additionally, your provider may not provide introspection endpoints for use by external resource servers. Offline validation is much more involved, typically requiring a validator to maintain a list of trusted signing keys for a provider and then check the token's cryptographic signature along with its contents. Implementations must follow the provider's instructions to the letter, including any verification of issuer ("where is this token from?"), audience ("who is this token for?"), and validity period ("when can this token be used?"). Since there is no communication between the module and the provider, tokens cannot be centrally revoked using this method; offline validator implementations may wish to place restrictions on the maximum length of a token's validity period. If the token cannot be validated, the module should immediately fail. Further authentication/authorization is pointless if the bearer token wasn't issued by a trusted party.
- Next the validator must ensure that the end user has given the client permission to access the server on their behalf. This generally involves checking the scopes that have been assigned to the token, to make sure that they cover database access for the current HBA parameters. The purpose of this step is to prevent an OAuth client from obtaining a token under false pretenses. If the validator requires all tokens to carry scopes that cover database access, the provider should then loudly prompt the user to grant that access during the flow. This gives them the opportunity to reject the request if the client isn't supposed to be using their credentials to connect to databases. While it is possible to establish client authorization without explicit scopes by using out-of-band knowledge of the deployed architecture, doing so removes the user from the loop, which prevents them from catching deployment mistakes and allows any such mistakes to be exploited silently. Access to the database must be tightly restricted to only trusted clients That is, "trusted" in the sense that the OAuth client and the PostgreSQL server are controlled by the same entity. Notably, the Device Authorization client flow supported by libpq does not usually meet this bar, since it's designed for use by public/untrusted clients. if users are not prompted for additional scopes. Even if authorization fails, a module may choose to continue to pull authentication information from the token for use in auditing and debugging.
- Finally, the validator should determine a user identifier for the token, either by asking the provider for this information or by extracting it from the token itself, and return that identifier to the server (which will then make a final authorization decision using the HBA configuration). This identifier will be available within the session via system_user and recorded in the server logs if `guc-log-connections` is enabled. Different providers may record a variety of different authentication information for an end user, typically referred to as claims. Providers usually document which of these claims are trustworthy enough to use for authorization decisions and which are not. (For instance, it would probably not be wise to use an end user's full name as the identifier for authentication, since many providers allow users to change their display names arbitrarily.) Ultimately, the choice of which claim (or combination of claims) to use comes down to the provider implementation and application requirements. Note that anonymous/pseudonymous login is possible as well, by enabling usermap delegation; see `oauth-validator-design-usermap-delegation`.

## General Coding Guidelines

Developers should keep the following in mind when implementing token validation:

- Modules should not write tokens, or pieces of tokens, into the server log. This is true even if the module considers the token invalid; an attacker who confuses a client into communicating with the wrong provider should not be able to retrieve that (otherwise valid) token from the disk. Implementations that send tokens over the network (for example, to perform online token validation with a provider) must authenticate the peer and ensure that strong transport security is in use.
- To simply log the reason for a validation failure, modules may set the freeform `error_detail` field during the validate callback. (`error-style-guide` has guidelines for writing good `DETAIL` messages.) `error_detail` is printed only to the server log, as part of the final authentication failure message, and it is not shared with the client. Modules may also use the same logging facilities as standard extensions; however, the rules for emitting log entries to the client are subtly different during the authentication phase of the connection. Generally speaking, modules should log problems at the `COMMERROR` level and return normally, instead of using `ERROR`/`FATAL` to unwind the stack, to avoid leaking information to unauthenticated clients.
- Modules must remain interruptible by signals so that the server can correctly handle authentication timeouts and shutdown signals from `pg_ctl`. For example, blocking calls on sockets should generally be replaced with code that handles both socket events and interrupts without races (see `WaitLatchOrSocket()`, `WaitEventSetWait()`, et al), and long-running loops should periodically call `CHECK_FOR_INTERRUPTS()`. Failure to follow this guidance may result in unresponsive backend sessions.
- The breadth of testing an OAuth system is well beyond the scope of this documentation, but at minimum, negative testing should be considered mandatory. It's trivial to design a module that lets authorized users in; the whole point of the system is to keep unauthorized users out.
- Validator implementations should document the contents and format of the authenticated ID that is reported to the server for each end user, since DBAs may need to use this information to construct pg_ident maps. (For instance, is it an email address? an organizational ID number? a UUID?) They should also document whether or not it is safe to use the module in `delegate_ident_mapping=1` mode, and what additional configuration is required in order to do so. If an implementation provides custom HBA options, the names and syntax of those options should be documented as well.

## Authorizing Users (Usermap Delegation)

The standard deliverable of a validation module is the user identifier, which the server will then compare to any configured pg_ident.conf mappings and determine whether the end user is authorized to connect. However, OAuth is itself an authorization framework, and tokens may carry information about user privileges. For example, a token may be associated with the organizational groups that a user belongs to, or list the roles that a user may assume, and duplicating that knowledge into local usermaps for every server may not be desirable.

To bypass username mapping entirely, and have the validator module assume the additional responsibility of authorizing user connections, the HBA may be configured with `auth-oauth-delegate-ident-mapping`. The module may then use token scopes or an equivalent method to decide whether the user is allowed to connect under their desired role. The user identifier will still be recorded by the server, but it plays no part in determining whether to continue the connection.

Using this scheme, authentication itself is optional. As long as the module reports that the connection is authorized, login will continue even if there is no recorded user identifier at all. This makes it possible to implement anonymous or pseudonymous access to the database, where the third-party provider performs all necessary authentication but does not provide any user-identifying information to the server. (Some providers may create an anonymized ID number that can be recorded instead, for later auditing.)

Usermap delegation provides the most architectural flexibility, but it turns the validator module into a single point of failure for connection authorization. Use with caution.

## Initialization Functions

_PG_oauth_validator_module_init

OAuth validator modules are dynamically loaded from the shared libraries listed in `guc-oauth-validator-libraries`. Modules are loaded on demand when requested from a login in progress. The normal library search path is used to locate the library. To provide the validator callbacks and to indicate that the library is an OAuth validator module a function named `_PG_oauth_validator_module_init` must be provided. The return value of the function must be a pointer to a struct of type `OAuthValidatorCallbacks`, which contains a magic number and pointers to the module's token validation functions. The returned pointer must be of server lifetime, which is typically achieved by defining it as a `static const` variable in global scope.

```
typedef struct OAuthValidatorCallbacks
{
    uint32        magic;            /* must be set to PG_OAUTH_VALIDATOR_MAGIC */

    ValidatorStartupCB startup_cb;
    ValidatorShutdownCB shutdown_cb;
    ValidatorValidateCB validate_cb;
} OAuthValidatorCallbacks;

typedef const OAuthValidatorCallbacks *(*OAuthValidatorModuleInit) (void);
```

Only the `validate_cb` callback is required, the others are optional.

## OAuth Validator Callbacks

OAuth validator modules implement their functionality by defining a set of callbacks. The server will call them as required to process the authentication request from the user.

## Startup Callback

The `startup_cb` callback is executed directly after loading the module. This callback can be used to set up local state, define custom HBA options, and perform additional initialization if required. If the validator module has state it can use `state->private_data` to store it.

```
typedef void (*ValidatorStartupCB) (ValidatorModuleState *state);
```

## Validate Callback

The `validate_cb` callback is executed during the OAuth exchange when a user attempts to authenticate using OAuth. Any state set in previous calls will be available in `state->private_data`.

```
typedef bool (*ValidatorValidateCB) (const ValidatorModuleState *state,
                                     const char *token, const char *role,
                                     ValidatorModuleResult *result);
```

`token` will contain the bearer token to validate. `PostgreSQL` has ensured that the token is well-formed syntactically, but no other validation has been performed. `role` will contain the role the user has requested to log in as. The callback must set output parameters in the `result` struct, which is defined as below:

```
typedef struct ValidatorModuleResult
{
    bool        authorized;
    char       *authn_id;
    char       *error_detail;
} ValidatorModuleResult;
```

The connection will only proceed if the module sets `result->authorized` to `true`. To authenticate the user, the authenticated user name (as determined using the token) shall be palloc'd and returned in the `result->authn_id` field. Alternatively, `result->authn_id` may be set to NULL if the token is valid but the associated user identity cannot be determined. If the validator returns `true` and set `result->authn_id` then the identity appears in the server log when `guc-log-connections` includes `authentication`. This happens before authorization and will log authentication even if the connection is later rejected due to authorization.

A validator may return `false` to signal an internal error, in which case the connection fails. Otherwise the validator should return `true` to indicate that it has processed the token and made an authorization decision.

In either failure case (validation error or internal error) the module may store a user-readable reason for the failure in `result->error_detail`. This will be printed to the server logs (not sent to the client) as a `DETAIL` entry for the authentication failure. The memory pointed to by `error_detail` may be either palloc'd or of static duration. `error_detail` is ignored on success.

The behavior after `validate_cb` returns depends on the specific HBA setup. Normally, the `result->authn_id` user name must exactly match the role that the user is logging in as. (This behavior may be modified with a usermap.) But when authenticating against an HBA rule with `delegate_ident_mapping` turned on, PostgreSQL will not perform any checks on the value of `result->authn_id` at all; in this case it is up to the validator to ensure that the token carries enough privileges for the user to log in under the indicated `role`.

## Shutdown Callback

The `shutdown_cb` callback is executed when the server backend has finished validating tokens for the connection. If the validator module has any allocated state, this callback should free it to avoid resource leaks.

```
typedef void (*ValidatorShutdownCB) (ValidatorModuleState *state);
```

## Custom HBA Options

Like other preloaded libraries, validator modules may define custom GUC parameters for user configuration in `postgresql.conf`. However, it may be desirable to configure behavior at a more granular level (say, for a particular issuer or a group of users) instead of globally.

Beginning in PostgreSQL 19, validator implementations may define custom options for use inside `pg_hba.conf`. These options are then made available to the user as `validator.option`. The API for registering and retrieving custom options is described below.

## Options API

Modules register custom HBA option names during the `startup_cb` callback, using `RegisterOAuthHBAOptions()`:

```
/*
 * Register a list of custom option names for use in pg_hba.conf. For each name
 * "foo" registered here, that option will be provided as "validator.foo" in
 * the HBA.
 *
 * Valid option names consist of alphanumeric ASCII, underscore (_), and hyphen
 * (-). Invalid option names will be ignored with a WARNING logged at
 * connection time.
 *
 * This function may only be called during the startup_cb callback. Multiple
 * calls are permitted, which will append to the existing list of registered
 * options; options cannot be unregistered.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * - state: the state pointer passed to the startup_cb callback
 * - num:   the number of options in the opts array
 * - opts:  an array of null-terminated option names to register
 *
 * The list of option names is copied internally, and the opts array is not
 * required to remain valid after the call.
 */
void RegisterOAuthHBAOptions(ValidatorModuleState *state, int num,
                             const char *opts[]);
```

Each option's value, if set, may be later retrieved using `GetOAuthHBAOption()`:

```
/*
 * Retrieve the string value of an HBA option which was registered via
 * RegisterOAuthHBAOptions(). Usable only during validate_cb or shutdown_cb.
 *
 * If the user has set the corresponding option in pg_hba.conf, this function
 * returns that value as a null-terminated string, which must not be modified
 * or freed. NULL is returned instead if the user has not set this option, if
 * the option name was not registered, or if this function is incorrectly called
 * during the startup_cb.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *
 * - state:   the state pointer passed to the validate_cb/shutdown_cb callback
 * - optname: the name of the option to retrieve
 */
const char *GetOAuthHBAOption(const ValidatorModuleState *state,
                              const char *optname);
```

See `oauth-validator-hba-example-usage` for sample usage.

## Limitations

- Option names are limited to ASCII alphanumeric characters, underscores (`_`), and hyphens (`-`). - Option values are always freeform strings (in contrast to custom GUCs, which support numerics, booleans, and enums). - Option names and values cannot be checked by the server during a reload of the configuration. Any unregistered options in `pg_hba.conf` will instead result in connection failures. It is the responsibility of each module to document and verify the syntax of option values as needed. If a module finds an invalid option value during `validate_cb`, it's recommended to signal an internal error by setting `result->error_detail` to a description of the problem and returning `false`.

## Example Usage

For a hypothetical module, the options `foo` and `bar` could be registered as follows:

```
static void
validator_startup(ValidatorModuleState *state)
{
    static const char *opts[] = {
        "foo",      /* description of access privileges */
        "bar",      /* magic URL for additional administrator powers */
    };

    RegisterOAuthHBAOptions(state, lengthof(opts), opts);

    /* ...other setup... */
}
```

The following sample entries in `pg_hba.conf` can then make use of these options:

```
# TYPE   DATABASE   USER   ADDRESS    METHOD
hostssl  postgres   admin  0.0.0.0/0  oauth issuer=https://admin.example.com \
                                            scope="pg-admin openid email" \
                                            map=oauth-email \
                                            validator.foo="admin access" \
                                            validator.bar=https://magic.example.com

hostssl  postgres   all    0.0.0.0/0  oauth issuer=https://www.example.com \
                                            scope="pg-user openid email" \
                                            map=oauth-email \
                                            validator.foo="user access"
```

The module can retrieve the option settings from the HBA during validation:

```
static bool
validate_token(const ValidatorModuleState *state,
               const char *token, const char *role,
               ValidatorModuleResult *res)
{
    const char *foo = GetOAuthHBAOption(state, "foo"); /* "admin access" or "user access" */
    const char *bar = GetOAuthHBAOption(state, "bar"); /* "https://magic.example.com" or NULL */

    if (bar && !is_valid_url(bar))
    {
        res->error_detail = psprintf("validator.bar (\"%s\") is not a valid URL.", bar);
        return false;
    }

    /* proceed to validate token */
}
```

When multiple validators are in use, their registered option lists remain independent:

```
in postgresql.conf:
oauth_validator_libraries = 'example_org, my_validator'

in pg_hba.conf:
# TYPE   DATABASE   USER   ADDRESS    METHOD
hostssl  postgres   admin  0.0.0.0/0  oauth issuer=https://admin.example.com \
                                            scope="pg-admin openid email" \
                                            map=oauth-email \
                                            validator=my_validator \
                                            validator.foo="admin access" \
                                            validator.bar=https://magic.example.com

hostssl  postgres   all    0.0.0.0/0  oauth issuer=https://www.example.org \
                                            scope="pg-user openid profile" \
                                            validator=example_org \
                                            delegate_ident_mapping=1 \
                                            validator.magic=on \
                                            validator.more_magic=off
```
