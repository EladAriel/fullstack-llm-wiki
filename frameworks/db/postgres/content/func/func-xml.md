## XML Functions

XML Functions

The functions and function-like expressions described in this section operate on values of type `xml`. See `datatype-xml` for information about the `xml` type. The function-like expressions `xmlparse` and `xmlserialize` for converting to and from type `xml` are documented there, not in this section.

Use of most of these functions requires PostgreSQL to have been built with `configure --with-libxml`.

## Producing XML Content

A set of functions and function-like expressions is available for producing XML content from SQL data. As such, they are particularly suitable for formatting query results into XML documents for processing in client applications.

## `xmltext`

xmltext

```
xmltext ( text ) xml
```

The function `xmltext` returns an XML value with a single text node containing the input argument as its content. Predefined entities like ampersand (`&`), left and right angle brackets (``), and quotation marks (`""`) are escaped.

Example:

```
SELECT xmltext('');
         xmltext
-------------------------
 < foo & bar >
```

## `xmlcomment`

xmlcomment

```
xmlcomment ( text ) xml
```

The function `xmlcomment` creates an XML value containing an XML comment with the specified text as content. The text cannot contain `--` or end with a `-`, otherwise the resulting construct would not be a valid XML comment. If the argument is null, the result is null.

Example:

```
SELECT xmlcomment('hello');

  xmlcomment
--------------
 
```

## `xmlconcat`

xmlconcat

```
xmlconcat ( xml , ... ) xml
```

The function `xmlconcat` concatenates a list of individual XML values to create a single value containing an XML content fragment. Null values are omitted; the result is only null if there are no nonnull arguments.

Example:

```
SELECT xmlconcat('', 'foo');

      xmlconcat
----------------------
 foo
```

XML declarations, if present, are combined as follows. If all argument values have the same XML version declaration, that version is used in the result, else no version is used. If all argument values have the standalone declaration value yes, then that value is used in the result. If all argument values have a standalone declaration value and at least one is no, then that is used in the result. Else the result will have no standalone declaration. If the result is determined to require a standalone declaration but no version declaration, a version declaration with version 1.0 will be used because XML requires an XML declaration to contain a version declaration. Encoding declarations are ignored and removed in all cases.

Example:

```
SELECT xmlconcat('', '');

             xmlconcat
-----------------------------------
 
```

## `xmlelement`

xmlelement

```
xmlelement ( NAME name , XMLATTRIBUTES ( attvalue  AS attname  , ... )  , content , ... ) xml
```

The `xmlelement` expression produces an XML element with the given name, attributes, and content. The `name` and `attname` items shown in the syntax are simple identifiers, not values. The `attvalue` and `content` items are expressions, which can yield any PostgreSQL data type. The argument(s) within `XMLATTRIBUTES` generate attributes of the XML element; the `content` value(s) are concatenated to form its content.

Examples:

```
SELECT xmlelement(NAME foo);

 xmlelement
------------
 

SELECT xmlelement(NAME foo, xmlattributes('xyz' AS bar));

    xmlelement
------------------
 

SELECT xmlelement(NAME foo, xmlattributes(current_date AS bar), 'cont', 'ent');

             xmlelement
-------------------------------------
 content
```

Element and attribute names that are not valid XML names are escaped by replacing the offending characters by the sequence `_xHHHH_`, where `HHHH` is the character's Unicode codepoint in hexadecimal notation. For example:

```
SELECT xmlelement(NAME "foo$bar", xmlattributes('xyz' AS "a&b"));

            xmlelement
----------------------------------
 
```

An explicit attribute name need not be specified if the attribute value is a column reference, in which case the column's name will be used as the attribute name by default. In other cases, the attribute must be given an explicit name. So this example is valid:

```
CREATE TABLE test (a xml, b xml);
SELECT xmlelement(NAME test, xmlattributes(a, b)) FROM test;
```

But these are not:

```
SELECT xmlelement(NAME test, xmlattributes('constant'), a, b) FROM test;
SELECT xmlelement(NAME test, xmlattributes(func(a, b))) FROM test;
```

Element content, if specified, will be formatted according to its data type. If the content is itself of type `xml`, complex XML documents can be constructed. For example:

```
SELECT xmlelement(NAME foo, xmlattributes('xyz' AS bar),
                            xmlelement(NAME abc),
                            xmlcomment('test'),
                            xmlelement(NAME xyz));

                  xmlelement
----------------------------------------------
 
```

Content of other types will be formatted into valid XML character data. This means in particular that the characters , and & will be converted to entities. Binary data (data type `bytea`) will be represented in base64 or hex encoding, depending on the setting of the configuration parameter `guc-xmlbinary`. The particular behavior for individual data types is expected to evolve in order to align the PostgreSQL mappings with those specified in SQL:2006 and later, as discussed in `functions-xml-limits-casts`.

## `xmlforest`

xmlforest

```
xmlforest ( content  AS name  , ... ) xml
```

The `xmlforest` expression produces an XML forest (sequence) of elements using the given names and content. As for `xmlelement`, each `name` must be a simple identifier, while the `content` expressions can have any data type.

Examples:

```
SELECT xmlforest('abc' AS foo, 123 AS bar);

          xmlforest
------------------------------
 <foo>abc</foo><bar>123</bar>

SELECT xmlforest(table_name, column_name)
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'pg_catalog';

                                xmlforest
------------------------------------zwsp-----------------------------------
 <table_name>pg_authid</table_name>zwsp<column_name>rolname</column_name>
 <table_name>pg_authid</table_name>zwsp<column_name>rolsuper</column_name>
 ...
```

As seen in the second example, the element name can be omitted if the content value is a column reference, in which case the column name is used by default. Otherwise, a name must be specified.

Element names that are not valid XML names are escaped as shown for `xmlelement` above. Similarly, content data is escaped to make valid XML content, unless it is already of type `xml`.

Note that XML forests are not valid XML documents if they consist of more than one element, so it might be useful to wrap `xmlforest` expressions in `xmlelement`.

## `xmlpi`

xmlpi

```
xmlpi ( NAME name , content  ) xml
```

The `xmlpi` expression creates an XML processing instruction. As for `xmlelement`, the `name` must be a simple identifier, while the `content` expression can have any data type. The `content`, if present, must not contain the character sequence `?>`.

Example:

```
SELECT xmlpi(name php, 'echo "hello world";');

            xmlpi
-----------------------------
 
```

## `xmlroot`

xmlroot

```
xmlroot ( xml, VERSION {text|NO VALUE} , STANDALONE {YES|NO|NO VALUE}  ) xml
```

The `xmlroot` expression alters the properties of the root node of an XML value. If a version is specified, it replaces the value in the root node's version declaration; if a standalone setting is specified, it replaces the value in the root node's standalone declaration.

```
SELECT xmlroot(xmlparse(document 'abc'),
               version '1.0', standalone yes);

                xmlroot
----------------------------------------
 
 abc
```

## `xmlagg`

xmlagg

```
xmlagg ( xml ) xml
```

The function `xmlagg` is, unlike the other functions described here, an aggregate function. It concatenates the input values to the aggregate function call, much like `xmlconcat` does, except that concatenation occurs across rows rather than across expressions in a single row. See `functions-aggregate` for additional information about aggregate functions.

Example:

```
CREATE TABLE test (y int, x xml);
INSERT INTO test VALUES (1, 'abc');
INSERT INTO test VALUES (2, '');
SELECT xmlagg(x) FROM test;
        xmlagg
----------------------
 abc
```

To determine the order of the concatenation, an `ORDER BY` clause may be added to the aggregate call as described in `syntax-aggregates`. For example:

```
SELECT xmlagg(x ORDER BY y DESC) FROM test;
        xmlagg
----------------------
 abc
```

The following non-standard approach used to be recommended in previous versions, and may still be useful in specific cases:

```
SELECT xmlagg(x) FROM (SELECT * FROM test ORDER BY y DESC) AS tab;
        xmlagg
----------------------
 abc
```

## XML Predicates

The expressions described in this section check properties of `xml` values.

## `IS DOCUMENT`

IS DOCUMENT

```
xml IS DOCUMENT boolean
```

The expression `IS DOCUMENT` returns true if the argument XML value is a proper XML document, false if it is not (that is, it is a content fragment), or null if the argument is null. See `datatype-xml` about the difference between documents and content fragments.

## `IS NOT DOCUMENT`

IS NOT DOCUMENT

```
xml IS NOT DOCUMENT boolean
```

The expression `IS NOT DOCUMENT` returns false if the argument XML value is a proper XML document, true if it is not (that is, it is a content fragment), or null if the argument is null.

## `XMLEXISTS`

XMLEXISTS

```
XMLEXISTS ( text PASSING BY {REF|VALUE} xml BY {REF|VALUE} ) boolean
```

The function `xmlexists` evaluates an XPath 1.0 expression (the first argument), with the passed XML value as its context item. The function returns false if the result of that evaluation yields an empty node-set, true if it yields any other value. The function returns null if any argument is null. A nonnull value passed as the context item must be an XML document, not a content fragment or any non-XML value.

Example:

```
SELECT xmlexists('//town[text() = ''Toronto'']' PASSING BY VALUE 'TorontoOttawa');

 xmlexists
------------
 t
(1 row)
```

The `BY REF` and `BY VALUE` clauses are accepted in PostgreSQL, but are ignored, as discussed in `functions-xml-limits-postgresql`.

In the SQL standard, the `xmlexists` function evaluates an expression in the XML Query language, but PostgreSQL allows only an XPath 1.0 expression, as discussed in `functions-xml-limits-xpath1`.

## `xml_is_well_formed`

xml_is_well_formed

xml_is_well_formed_document

xml_is_well_formed_content

```
xml_is_well_formed ( text ) boolean
xml_is_well_formed_document ( text ) boolean
xml_is_well_formed_content ( text ) boolean
```

These functions check whether a `text` string represents well-formed XML, returning a Boolean result. `xml_is_well_formed_document` checks for a well-formed document, while `xml_is_well_formed_content` checks for well-formed content. `xml_is_well_formed` does the former if the `guc-xmloption` configuration parameter is set to `DOCUMENT`, or the latter if it is set to `CONTENT`. This means that `xml_is_well_formed` is useful for seeing whether a simple cast to type `xml` will succeed, whereas the other two functions are useful for seeing whether the corresponding variants of `XMLPARSE` will succeed.

Examples:

```
SET xmloption TO DOCUMENT;
SELECT xml_is_well_formed('<>');
 xml_is_well_formed
--------------------
 f
(1 row)

SELECT xml_is_well_formed('');
 xml_is_well_formed
--------------------
 t
(1 row)

SET xmloption TO CONTENT;
SELECT xml_is_well_formed('abc');
 xml_is_well_formed
--------------------
 t
(1 row)

SELECT xml_is_well_formed_document('bar');
 xml_is_well_formed_document
-----------------------------
 t
(1 row)

SELECT xml_is_well_formed_document('bar');
 xml_is_well_formed_document
-----------------------------
 f
(1 row)
```

The last example shows that the checks include whether namespaces are correctly matched.

## Processing XML

To process values of data type `xml`, PostgreSQL offers the functions `xpath` and `xpath_exists`, which evaluate XPath 1.0 expressions, and the `XMLTABLE` table function.

## `xpath`

XPath

```
xpath ( xpath text, xml xml , nsarray text[]  ) xml[]
```

The function `xpath` evaluates the XPath 1.0 expression `xpath` (given as text) against the XML value `xml`. It returns an array of XML values corresponding to the node-set produced by the XPath expression. If the XPath expression returns a scalar value rather than a node-set, a single-element array is returned.

The second argument must be a well formed XML document. In particular, it must have a single root node element.

The optional third argument of the function is an array of namespace mappings. This array should be a two-dimensional `text` array with the length of the second axis being equal to 2 (i.e., it should be an array of arrays, each of which consists of exactly 2 elements). The first element of each array entry is the namespace name (alias), the second the namespace URI. It is not required that aliases provided in this array be the same as those being used in the XML document itself (in other words, both in the XML document and in the `xpath` function context, aliases are local).

Example:

```
SELECT xpath('/my:a/text()', 'test',
             ARRAY[ARRAY['my', 'http://example.com']]);

 xpath
--------
 {test}
(1 row)
```

To deal with default (anonymous) namespaces, do something like this:

```
SELECT xpath('//mydefns:b/text()', 'test',
             ARRAY[ARRAY['mydefns', 'http://example.com']]);

 xpath
--------
 {test}
(1 row)
```

## `xpath_exists`

xpath_exists

```
xpath_exists ( xpath text, xml xml , nsarray text[]  ) boolean
```

The function `xpath_exists` is a specialized form of the `xpath` function. Instead of returning the individual XML values that satisfy the XPath 1.0 expression, this function returns a Boolean indicating whether the query was satisfied or not (specifically, whether it produced any value other than an empty node-set). This function is equivalent to the `XMLEXISTS` predicate, except that it also offers support for a namespace mapping argument.

Example:

```
SELECT xpath_exists('/my:a/text()', 'test',
                     ARRAY[ARRAY['my', 'http://example.com']]);

 xpath_exists
--------------
 t
(1 row)
```

## `xmltable`

xmltable

table function
XMLTABLE

```
XMLTABLE (
     XMLNAMESPACES ( namespace_uri AS namespace_name , ... ), 
    row_expression PASSING BY {REF|VALUE} document_expression BY {REF|VALUE}
    COLUMNS name { type PATH column_expression DEFAULT default_expression NOT NULL | NULL
                  | FOR ORDINALITY }
            , ...
) setof record
```

The `xmltable` expression produces a table based on an XML value, an XPath filter to extract rows, and a set of column definitions. Although it syntactically resembles a function, it can only appear as a table in a query's `FROM` clause.

The optional `XMLNAMESPACES` clause gives a comma-separated list of namespace definitions, where each `namespace_uri` is a `text` expression and each `namespace_name` is a simple identifier. It specifies the XML namespaces used in the document and their aliases. A default namespace specification is not currently supported.

The required `row_expression` argument is an XPath 1.0 expression (given as `text`) that is evaluated, passing the XML value `document_expression` as its context item, to obtain a set of XML nodes. These nodes are what `xmltable` transforms into output rows. No rows will be produced if the `document_expression` is null, nor if the `row_expression` produces an empty node-set or any value other than a node-set.

`document_expression` provides the context item for the `row_expression`. It must be a well-formed XML document; fragments/forests are not accepted. The `BY REF` and `BY VALUE` clauses are accepted but ignored, as discussed in `functions-xml-limits-postgresql`.

In the SQL standard, the `xmltable` function evaluates expressions in the XML Query language, but PostgreSQL allows only XPath 1.0 expressions, as discussed in `functions-xml-limits-xpath1`.

The required `COLUMNS` clause specifies the column(s) that will be produced in the output table. See the syntax summary above for the format. A name is required for each column, as is a data type (unless `FOR ORDINALITY` is specified, in which case type `integer` is implicit). The path, default and nullability clauses are optional.

A column marked `FOR ORDINALITY` will be populated with row numbers, starting with 1, in the order of nodes retrieved from the `row_expression`'s result node-set. At most one column may be marked `FOR ORDINALITY`.

XPath 1.0 does not specify an order for nodes in a node-set, so code that relies on a particular order of the results will be implementation-dependent. Details can be found in `xml-xpath-1-specifics`.

The `column_expression` for a column is an XPath 1.0 expression that is evaluated for each row, with the current node from the `row_expression` result as its context item, to find the value of the column. If no `column_expression` is given, then the column name is used as an implicit path.

If a column's XPath expression returns a non-XML value (which is limited to string, boolean, or double in XPath 1.0) and the column has a PostgreSQL type other than `xml`, the column will be set as if by assigning the value's string representation to the PostgreSQL type. (If the value is a boolean, its string representation is taken to be `1` or `0` if the output column's type category is numeric, otherwise `true` or `false`.)

If a column's XPath expression returns a non-empty set of XML nodes and the column's PostgreSQL type is `xml`, the column will be assigned the expression result exactly, if it is of document or content form. A result containing more than one element node at the top level, or non-whitespace text outside of an element, is an example of content form. An XPath result can be of neither form, for example if it returns an attribute node selected from the element that contains it. Such a result will be put into content form with each such disallowed node replaced by its string value, as defined for the XPath 1.0 `string` function.

A non-XML result assigned to an `xml` output column produces content, a single text node with the string value of the result. An XML result assigned to a column of any other type may not have more than one node, or an error is raised. If there is exactly one node, the column will be set as if by assigning the node's string value (as defined for the XPath 1.0 `string` function) to the PostgreSQL type.

The string value of an XML element is the concatenation, in document order, of all text nodes contained in that element and its descendants. The string value of an element with no descendant text nodes is an empty string (not `NULL`). Any `xsi:nil` attributes are ignored. Note that the whitespace-only `text()` node between two non-text elements is preserved, and that leading whitespace on a `text()` node is not flattened. The XPath 1.0 `string` function may be consulted for the rules defining the string value of other XML node types and non-XML values.

The conversion rules presented here are not exactly those of the SQL standard, as discussed in `functions-xml-limits-casts`.

If the path expression returns an empty node-set (typically, when it does not match) for a given row, the column will be set to `NULL`, unless a `default_expression` is specified; then the value resulting from evaluating that expression is used.

A `default_expression`, rather than being evaluated immediately when `xmltable` is called, is evaluated each time a default is needed for the column. If the expression qualifies as stable or immutable, the repeat evaluation may be skipped. This means that you can usefully use volatile functions like `nextval` in `default_expression`.

Columns may be marked `NOT NULL`. If the `column_expression` for a `NOT NULL` column does not match anything and there is no `DEFAULT` or the `default_expression` also evaluates to null, an error is reported.

Examples:

```
CREATE TABLE xmldata AS SELECT
xml $$

  
    AU
    Australia
  
  
    JP
    Japan
    Shinzo Abe
    145935
  
  
    SG
    Singapore
    697
  

$$ AS data;

SELECT xmltable.*
  FROM xmldata,
       XMLTABLE('//ROWS/ROW'
                PASSING data
                COLUMNS id int PATH '@id',
                        ordinality FOR ORDINALITY,
                        "COUNTRY_NAME" text,
                        country_id text PATH 'COUNTRY_ID',
                        size_sq_km float PATH 'SIZE[@unit = "sq_km"]',
                        size_other text PATH
                             'concat(SIZE[@unit!="sq_km"], " ", SIZE[@unit!="sq_km"]/@unit)',
                        premier_name text PATH 'PREMIER_NAME' DEFAULT 'not specified');

 id | ordinality | COUNTRY_NAME | country_id | size_sq_km |  size_other  | premier_name
----+------------+--------------+------------+------------+--------------+---------------
  1 |          1 | Australia    | AU         |            |              | not specified
  5 |          2 | Japan        | JP         |            | 145935 sq_mi | Shinzo Abe
  6 |          3 | Singapore    | SG         |        697 |              | not specified
```

The following example shows concatenation of multiple text() nodes, usage of the column name as XPath filter, and the treatment of whitespace, XML comments and processing instructions:

```
CREATE TABLE xmlelements AS SELECT
xml $$
  
     Hello2a2   bbbxxxCC  
  
$$ AS data;

SELECT xmltable.*
  FROM xmlelements, XMLTABLE('/root' PASSING data COLUMNS element text);
         element
-------------------------
   Hello2a2   bbbxxxCC
```

The following example illustrates how the `XMLNAMESPACES` clause can be used to specify a list of namespaces used in the XML document as well as in the XPath expressions:

```
WITH xmldata(data) AS (VALUES ('

 
 
 
'::xml)
)
SELECT xmltable.*
  FROM XMLTABLE(XMLNAMESPACES('http://example.com/myns' AS x,
                              'http://example.com/b' AS "B"),
             '/x:example/x:item'
                PASSING (SELECT data FROM xmldata)
                COLUMNS foo int PATH '@foo',
                  bar int PATH '@B:bar');
 foo | bar
-----+-----
   1 |   2
   3 |   4
   4 |   5
(3 rows)
```

## Mapping Tables to XML

XML export

The following functions map the contents of relational tables to XML values. They can be thought of as XML export functionality:

```
table_to_xml ( table regclass, nulls boolean,
               tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
query_to_xml ( query text, nulls boolean,
               tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
cursor_to_xml ( cursor refcursor, count integer, nulls boolean,
                tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
```

`table_to_xml` maps the content of the named table, passed as parameter `table`. The `regclass` type accepts strings identifying tables using the usual notation, including optional schema qualification and double quotes (see `datatype-oid` for details). `query_to_xml` executes the query whose text is passed as parameter `query` and maps the result set. `cursor_to_xml` fetches the indicated number of rows from the cursor specified by the parameter `cursor`. This variant is recommended if large tables have to be mapped, because the result value is built up in memory by each function.

If `tableforest` is false, then the resulting XML document looks like this:

```
  
    data
    data
  

  
    ...
  

  ...
```

If `tableforest` is true, the result is an XML content fragment that looks like this:

```
  data
  data

  ...

...
```

If no table name is available, that is, when mapping a query or a cursor, the string `table` is used in the first format, `row` in the second format.

The choice between these formats is up to the user. The first format is a proper XML document, which will be important in many applications. The second format tends to be more useful in the `cursor_to_xml` function if the result values are to be reassembled into one document later on. The functions for producing XML content discussed above, in particular `xmlelement`, can be used to alter the results to taste.

The data values are mapped in the same way as described for the function `xmlelement` above.

The parameter `nulls` determines whether null values should be included in the output. If true, null values in columns are represented as:

```

```

where `xsi` is the XML namespace prefix for XML Schema Instance. An appropriate namespace declaration will be added to the result value. If false, columns containing null values are simply omitted from the output.

The parameter `targetns` specifies the desired XML namespace of the result. If no particular namespace is wanted, an empty string should be passed.

The following functions return XML Schema documents describing the mappings performed by the corresponding functions above:

```
table_to_xmlschema ( table regclass, nulls boolean,
                     tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
query_to_xmlschema ( query text, nulls boolean,
                     tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
cursor_to_xmlschema ( cursor refcursor, nulls boolean,
                      tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
```

It is essential that the same parameters are passed in order to obtain matching XML data mappings and XML Schema documents.

The following functions produce XML data mappings and the corresponding XML Schema in one document (or forest), linked together. They can be useful where self-contained and self-describing results are wanted:

```
table_to_xml_and_xmlschema ( table regclass, nulls boolean,
                             tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
query_to_xml_and_xmlschema ( query text, nulls boolean,
                             tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
```

In addition, the following functions are available to produce analogous mappings of entire schemas or the entire current database:

```
schema_to_xml ( schema name, nulls boolean,
                tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
schema_to_xmlschema ( schema name, nulls boolean,
                      tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml
schema_to_xml_and_xmlschema ( schema name, nulls boolean,
                              tableforest boolean, targetns text ) xml

database_to_xml ( nulls boolean,

These functions ignore tables that are not readable by the current user. The database-wide functions additionally ignore schemas that the current user does not have `USAGE` (lookup) privilege for.

Note that these potentially produce a lot of data, which needs to be built up in memory. When requesting content mappings of large schemas or databases, it might be worthwhile to consider mapping the tables separately instead, possibly even through a cursor.

The result of a schema content mapping looks like this:

```
table1-mapping

table2-mapping

...
```

where the format of a table mapping depends on the `tableforest` parameter as explained above.

The result of a database content mapping looks like this:

```
  ...

  ...

...
```

where the schema mapping is as above.

As an example of using the output produced by these functions, `xslt-xml-html` shows an XSLT stylesheet that converts the output of `table_to_xml_and_xmlschema` to an HTML document containing a tabular rendition of the table data. In a similar manner, the results from these functions can be converted into other XML-based formats.
