# Just-in-Time Compilation (JIT)

 
  JIT
 

 
  Just-In-Time compilation
  JIT
 

 
  This chapter explains what just-in-time compilation is, and how it can be
  configured in PostgreSQL.
 

 
  What Is JIT compilation?

  
   Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation is the process of turning
   some form of interpreted program evaluation into a native program, and
   doing so at run time.
   For example, instead of using general-purpose code that can evaluate
   arbitrary SQL expressions to evaluate a particular SQL predicate
   like WHERE a.col = 3, it is possible to generate a
   function that is specific to that expression and can be natively executed
   by the CPU, yielding a speedup.
  

  
   PostgreSQL has builtin support to perform
   JIT compilation using LLVM when
   PostgreSQL is built with
   --with-llvm.
  

  
   See src/backend/jit/README for further details.
  

  
   JIT Accelerated Operations
   
    Currently PostgreSQL's JIT
    implementation has support for accelerating expression evaluation and
    tuple deforming.  Several other operations could be accelerated in the
    future.
   
   
    Expression evaluation is used to evaluate WHERE
    clauses, target lists, aggregates and projections. It can be accelerated
    by generating code specific to each case.
   
   
    Tuple deforming is the process of transforming an on-disk tuple (see ) into its in-memory representation.
    It can be accelerated by creating a function specific to the table layout
    and the number of columns to be extracted.
   
  

  
   Inlining
   
    PostgreSQL is very extensible and allows new
    data types, functions, operators and other database objects to be defined;
    see . In fact the built-in objects are implemented
    using nearly the same mechanisms.  This extensibility implies some
    overhead, for example due to function calls (see ).
    To reduce that overhead, JIT compilation can inline the
    bodies of small functions into the expressions using them. That allows a
    significant percentage of the overhead to be optimized away.
   
  

  
   Optimization
   
    LLVM has support for optimizing generated
    code. Some of the optimizations are cheap enough to be performed whenever
    JIT is used, while others are only beneficial for
    longer-running queries.
    See  for
    more details about optimizations.
   
  

 

 
  When to JIT?

  
   JIT compilation is beneficial primarily for long-running
   CPU-bound queries. Frequently these will be analytical queries.  For short
   queries the added overhead of performing JIT compilation
   will often be higher than the time it can save.
  

  
   To determine whether JIT compilation should be used,
   the total estimated cost of a query (see
    and
   ) is used.
   The estimated cost of the query will be compared with the setting of . If the cost is higher,
   JIT compilation will be performed.
   Two further decisions are then needed.
   Firstly, if the estimated cost is more
   than the setting of , short
   functions and operators used in the query will be inlined.
   Secondly, if the estimated cost is more than the setting of , expensive optimizations are
   applied to improve the generated code.
   Each of these options increases the JIT compilation
   overhead, but can reduce query execution time considerably.
  

  
   These cost-based decisions will be made at plan time, not execution
   time. This means that when prepared statements are in use, and a generic
   plan is used (see ), the values of the
   configuration parameters in effect at prepare time control the decisions,
   not the settings at execution time.
  

  
   
    If  is set to off, or if no
    JIT implementation is available (for example because
    the server was compiled without --with-llvm),
    JIT will not be performed, even if it would be
    beneficial based on the above criteria.  Setting 
    to off has effects at both plan and execution time.
   
  

  
    can be used to see whether
   JIT is used or not.  As an example, here is a query that
   is not using JIT:

=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT SUM(relpages) FROM pg_class;
                                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------&zwsp;------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=16.27..16.29 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.303..0.303 rows=1.00 loops=1)
   Buffers: shared hit=14
   ->  Seq Scan on pg_class  (cost=0.00..15.42 rows=342 width=4) (actual time=0.017..0.111 rows=356.00 loops=1)
         Buffers: shared hit=14
 Planning Time: 0.116 ms
 Execution Time: 0.365 ms

   Given the cost of the plan, it is entirely reasonable that no
   JIT was used; the cost of JIT would
   have been bigger than the potential savings. Adjusting the cost limits
   will lead to JIT use:

=# SET jit_above_cost = 10;
SET
=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT SUM(relpages) FROM pg_class;
                                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------&zwsp;------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=16.27..16.29 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=6.049..6.049 rows=1.00 loops=1)
   Buffers: shared hit=14
   ->  Seq Scan on pg_class  (cost=0.00..15.42 rows=342 width=4) (actual time=0.019..0.052 rows=356.00 loops=1)
         Buffers: shared hit=14
 Planning Time: 0.133 ms
 JIT:
   Functions: 3
   Options: Inlining false, Optimization false, Expressions true, Deforming true
   Timing: Generation 1.259 ms (Deform 0.000 ms), Inlining 0.000 ms, Optimization 0.797 ms, Emission 5.048 ms, Total 7.104 ms
 Execution Time: 7.416 ms

   As visible here, JIT was used, but inlining and
   expensive optimization were not. If  or  were also lowered,
   that would change.
  
 

 
  Configuration

  
   The configuration variable
    determines whether JIT
   compilation is enabled or disabled.
   If it is enabled, the configuration variables
   , , and  determine
   whether JIT compilation is performed for a query,
   and how much effort is spent doing so.
  

  
    determines which JIT
   implementation is used. It is rarely required to be changed. See .
  

  
   For development and debugging purposes a few additional configuration
   parameters exist, as described in
   .
  
 

 
  Extensibility

  
   Inlining Support for Extensions
   
    PostgreSQL's JIT
    implementation can inline the bodies of functions
    of types C and internal, as well as
    operators based on such functions.  To do so for functions in extensions,
    the definitions of those functions need to be made available.
    When using PGXS to build an extension
    against a server that has been compiled with LLVM JIT support, the
    relevant files will be built and installed automatically.
   

   
    The relevant files have to be installed into
    $pkglibdir/bitcode/$extension/ and a summary of them
    into $pkglibdir/bitcode/$extension.index.bc, where
    $pkglibdir is the directory returned by
    pg_config --pkglibdir and $extension
    is the base name of the extension's shared library.

    
     
      For functions built into PostgreSQL itself,
      the bitcode is installed into
      $pkglibdir/bitcode/postgres.
     
    
   
  

  
   Pluggable JIT Providers

   
    PostgreSQL provides a JIT
    implementation based on LLVM.  The interface to
    the JIT provider is pluggable and the provider can be
    changed without recompiling (although currently, the build process only
    provides inlining support data for LLVM).
    The active provider is chosen via the setting
    .
   

   
    JIT Provider Interface
    
     A JIT provider is loaded by dynamically loading the
     named shared library. The normal library search path is used to locate
     the library. To provide the required JIT provider
     callbacks and to indicate that the library is actually a
     JIT provider, it needs to provide a C function named
     _PG_jit_provider_init. This function is passed a
     struct that needs to be filled with the callback function pointers for
     individual actions:

struct JitProviderCallbacks
{
    JitProviderResetAfterErrorCB reset_after_error;
    JitProviderReleaseContextCB release_context;
    JitProviderCompileExprCB compile_expr;
};

extern void _PG_jit_provider_init(JitProviderCallbacks *cb);
