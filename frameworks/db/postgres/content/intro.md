# Preface

 
  This book is the official documentation of
  PostgreSQL.  It has been written by the
  PostgreSQL developers and other
  volunteers in parallel to the development of the
  PostgreSQL software.  It describes all
  the functionality that the current version of
  PostgreSQL officially supports.
 

 
  To make the large amount of information about
  PostgreSQL manageable, this book has been
  organized in several parts.  Each part is targeted at a different
  class of users, or at users in different stages of their
  PostgreSQL experience:

  
   
    
      is an informal introduction for new users.
    

   

   
    
      documents the SQL query
     language environment, including data types and functions, as well
     as user-level performance tuning.  Every
     PostgreSQL user should read this.
    

   

   
    
      describes the installation and
     administration of the server.  Everyone who runs a
     PostgreSQL server, be it for private
     use or for others, should read this part.
    

   

   
    
      describes the programming
     interfaces for PostgreSQL client
     programs.
    

   

   
    
      contains information for
     advanced users about the extensibility capabilities of the
     server.  Topics include user-defined data types and
     functions.
    

   

   
    
      contains reference information about
     SQL commands, client and server programs.  This part supports
     the other parts with structured information sorted by command or
     program.
    

   

   
    
      contains assorted information that might be of
     use to PostgreSQL developers.
    

   
  
 

 
# What Is PostgreSQL?

  
   PostgreSQL is an object-relational
   database management system (ORDBMS) based on
   
   POSTGRES, Version 4.2,
   developed at the University of California at Berkeley Computer Science
   Department.  POSTGRES pioneered many concepts that only became
   available in some commercial database systems much later.
  

  
   PostgreSQL is an open-source descendant
   of this original Berkeley code.  It supports a large part of the SQL
   standard and offers many modern features:

   
    
     complex queries
    
    
     foreign keys
    
    
     triggers
    
    
     updatable views
    
    
     transactional integrity
    
    
     multiversion concurrency control
    
   

   Also, PostgreSQL can be extended by the
   user in many ways, for example by adding new

   
    
     data types
    
    
     functions
    
    
     operators
    
    
     aggregate functions
    
    
     index methods
    
    
     procedural languages
    
   
  

  
   And because of the liberal license,
   PostgreSQL can be used, modified, and
   distributed by anyone free of charge for any purpose, be it
   private, commercial, or academic.
