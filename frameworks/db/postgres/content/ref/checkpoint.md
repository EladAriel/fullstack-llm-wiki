CHECKPOINT
 

 
  
# CHECKPOINT

  SQL - Language Statements
 

 
  
# CHECKPOINT

  force a write-ahead log checkpoint
 

 

CHECKPOINT [ ( option [, ...] ) ]

where option can be one of:

    FLUSH_UNLOGGED [ boolean ]
    MODE { FAST | SPREAD }

 

 
  
# Description

  
   A checkpoint is a point in the write-ahead log sequence at which
   all data files for permanent relations have been updated to reflect the
   information in the log.  All data for permanent relation files will be
   flushed to disk.  Dirty buffers of unlogged relations are not flushed unless
   FLUSH_UNLOGGED is specified.  Refer to
    for more details about what happens
   during a checkpoint.
  

  
   By default, the CHECKPOINT command forces a fast
   checkpoint when the command is issued, without waiting for a
   regular checkpoint scheduled by the system (controlled by the settings in
   ).
   To request the checkpoint be spread over a longer interval, set the
   MODE option to SPREAD.
   CHECKPOINT is not intended for use during normal
   operation.
  

  
   The server may consolidate concurrently requested checkpoints.  Such
   consolidated requests will contain a combined set of options.  For example,
   if one session requests a fast checkpoint and another requests a spread
   checkpoint, the server may combine those requests and perform one fast
   checkpoint.
  

  
   If executed during recovery, the CHECKPOINT command
   will force a restartpoint (see )
   rather than writing a new checkpoint.
  

  
   Only superusers or users with the privileges of
   the 
   role can call CHECKPOINT.
  

 

 
  
# Parameters

  
   
    FLUSH_UNLOGGED
    
     
      Normally, CHECKPOINT does not flush dirty buffers of
      unlogged relations.  This option, which is disabled by default, enables
      flushing unlogged relations to disk.
     

    
   

   
    MODE
    
     
      When set to FAST, which is the default, the requested
      checkpoint will be completed as fast as possible, which may result in a
      significantly higher rate of I/O during the checkpoint.
     

     
      MODE can also be set to SPREAD to
      request the checkpoint be spread over a longer interval (controlled via
      the settings in ), like a
      regular checkpoint scheduled by the system.  This can reduce the rate of
      I/O during the checkpoint.
     

    
   

   
    boolean
    
     
      Specifies whether the selected option should be turned on or off.
      You can write TRUE, ON, or
      1 to enable the option, and FALSE,
      OFF, or 0 to disable it.  The
      boolean value can also
      be omitted, in which case TRUE is assumed.
     

    
   
  
 

 
  
# Compatibility

  
   The CHECKPOINT command is a
   PostgreSQL language extension.
