ALTER TABLESPACE
 

 
  
# ALTER TABLESPACE

  7
  SQL - Language Statements
 

 
  
# ALTER TABLESPACE

  change the definition of a tablespace
 

 

ALTER TABLESPACE name RENAME TO new_name
ALTER TABLESPACE name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER TABLESPACE name SET ( tablespace_option = value [, ... ] )
ALTER TABLESPACE name RESET ( tablespace_option [, ... ] )

 

 
  
# Description

  
   ALTER TABLESPACE can be used to change the definition of
   a tablespace.
  

  
   You must own the tablespace to change the definition of a tablespace.
   To alter the owner, you must also be able to SET ROLE
   to the new owning role.
   (Note that superusers have these privileges automatically.)
  

 

 
  
# Parameters

  
   
    name
    
     
      The name of an existing tablespace.
     

    
   

   
    new_name
    
     
      The new name of the tablespace.  The new name cannot
      begin with pg_, as such names
      are reserved for system tablespaces.
     

    
   

   
    new_owner
    
     
      The new owner of the tablespace.
     

    
   

   
    tablespace_option
    
     
      A tablespace parameter to be set or reset.  Currently, the only
      available parameters are seq_page_cost,
      random_page_cost, effective_io_concurrency
      and maintenance_io_concurrency.
      Setting these values for a particular tablespace will override the
      planner's usual estimate of the cost of reading pages from tables in
      that tablespace, and how many concurrent I/Os are issued, as established
      by the configuration parameters of the
      same name (see ,
      ,
      ,
      ).  This may be useful if
      one tablespace is located on a disk which is faster or slower than the
      remainder of the I/O subsystem.
     

    
   

  
 

 
  
# Examples

  
   Rename tablespace index_space to fast_raid:

```

ALTER TABLESPACE index_space RENAME TO fast_raid;

```

  

  
   Change the owner of tablespace index_space:

```

ALTER TABLESPACE index_space OWNER TO mary;

```

 

 
  
# Compatibility

  
   There is no ALTER TABLESPACE statement in
   the SQL standard.
