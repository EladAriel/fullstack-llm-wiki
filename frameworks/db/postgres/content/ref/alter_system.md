ALTER SYSTEM
 

 
  
# ALTER SYSTEM

  SQL - Language Statements
 

 
  
# ALTER SYSTEM

  change a server configuration parameter
 

 

ALTER SYSTEM SET configuration_parameter { TO | = } { value [, ...] | DEFAULT }

ALTER SYSTEM RESET configuration_parameter
ALTER SYSTEM RESET ALL

 

 
  
# Description

  
   ALTER SYSTEM is used for changing server configuration
   parameters across the entire database cluster.  It can be more convenient
   than the traditional method of manually editing
   the postgresql.conf file.
   ALTER SYSTEM writes the given parameter setting to
   the postgresql.auto.conf file, which is read in
   addition to postgresql.conf.
   Setting a parameter to DEFAULT, or using the
   RESET variant, removes that configuration entry from the
   postgresql.auto.conf file. Use RESET
   ALL to remove all such configuration entries.
  

  
   Values set with ALTER SYSTEM will be effective after
   the next server configuration reload, or after the next server restart
   in the case of parameters that can only be changed at server start.
   A server configuration reload can be commanded by calling the SQL
   function pg_reload_conf(), running pg_ctl reload,
   or sending a SIGHUP signal to the main server process.
  

  
   Only superusers and users granted ALTER SYSTEM privilege
   on a parameter can change it using ALTER SYSTEM.  Also, since
   this command acts directly on the file system and cannot be rolled back,
   it is not allowed inside a transaction block or function.
  

 

 
  
# Parameters

  
   
    configuration_parameter
    
     
      Name of a settable configuration parameter.  Available parameters are
      documented in .
     

    
   

   
    value
    
     
      New value of the parameter.  Values can be specified as string
      constants, identifiers, numbers, or comma-separated lists of
      these, as appropriate for the particular parameter.
      Values that are neither numbers nor valid identifiers must be quoted.
      If the parameter accepts a list of values, NULL
      can be written to specify an empty list.
      DEFAULT can be written to specify removing the
      parameter and its value from postgresql.auto.conf.
     

     
      For some list-accepting parameters, quoted values will produce
      double-quoted output to preserve whitespace and commas; for others,
      double-quotes must be used inside single-quoted strings to get
      this effect.
     

    
   
  
 

 
  
# Notes

  
   This command can't be used to set ,
   ,
   nor parameters that are not allowed in postgresql.conf
   (e.g., preset options).
  

  
   See  for other ways to set the parameters.
  

  
   ALTER SYSTEM can be disabled by setting
    to off, but this
   is not a security mechanism (as explained in detail in the documentation for
   this parameter).
  

 

 
  
# Examples

  
   Set the wal_level:

```

ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = replica;

```

  

  
   Undo that, restoring whatever setting was effective
   in postgresql.conf:

```

ALTER SYSTEM RESET wal_level;

```

  

  
   Set the list of preloaded extension modules to be empty:

```

ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_preload_libraries TO NULL;

```

  

 

 
  
# Compatibility

  
   The ALTER SYSTEM statement is a
   PostgreSQL extension.
