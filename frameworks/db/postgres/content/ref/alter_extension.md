# Description

  
   ALTER EXTENSION changes the definition of an installed
   extension.  There are several subforms:

   
   
    UPDATE
    
     
      This form updates the extension to a newer version.  The extension
      must supply a suitable update script (or series of scripts) that can
      modify the currently-installed version into the requested version.
     

    
   

   
    SET SCHEMA
    
     
      This form moves the extension's objects into another schema. The
      extension has to be relocatable for this command to
      succeed.
     

    
   

   
    ADD member_object
    
     
      This form adds an existing object to the extension.  This is mainly
      useful in extension update scripts.  The object will subsequently
      be treated as a member of the extension; notably, it can only be
      dropped by dropping the extension.
     

    
   

   
    DROP member_object
    
     
      This form removes a member object from the extension.  This is mainly
      useful in extension update scripts.  The object is not dropped, only
      disassociated from the extension.
     

    
   
   

   See  for more information about these
   operations.
  

  
   You must own the extension to use ALTER EXTENSION.
   The ADD/DROP forms require ownership of the
   added/dropped object as well.
  

 

 
  
# Parameters

  
   
    
     name
     
      
       The name of an installed extension.
      

     
    

    
     new_version
     
      
       The desired new version of the extension.  This can be written as
       either an identifier or a string literal.  If not specified,
       ALTER EXTENSION UPDATE attempts to update to whatever is
       shown as the default version in the extension's control file.
      

     
    

    
     new_schema
     
      
       The new schema for the extension.
      

     
    

    
     object_name
     aggregate_name
     function_name
     operator_name
     procedure_name
     routine_name
     
      
       The name of an object to be added to or removed from the extension.
       Names of tables,
       aggregates, domains, foreign tables, functions, operators,
       operator classes, operator families, procedures, property graphs, routines, sequences, text search objects,
       types, and views can be schema-qualified.
      

     
    

    
     source_type
     
      
       The name of the source data type of the cast.
      

     
    

    
     target_type
     
      
       The name of the target data type of the cast.
      

     
    

    
     argmode

     
      
       The mode of a function, procedure, or aggregate
       argument: IN, OUT,
       INOUT, or VARIADIC.
       If omitted, the default is IN.
       Note that ALTER EXTENSION does not actually pay
       any attention to OUT arguments, since only the input
       arguments are needed to determine the function's identity.
       So it is sufficient to list the IN, INOUT,
       and VARIADIC arguments.
      

     
    

    
     argname

     
      
       The name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.
       Note that ALTER EXTENSION does not actually pay
       any attention to argument names, since only the argument data
       types are needed to determine the function's identity.
      

     
    

    
     argtype

     
      
       The data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.
      

     
    

    
     left_type
     right_type
     
      
       The data type(s) of the operator's arguments (optionally
       schema-qualified).  Write NONE for the missing argument
       of a prefix operator.
      

     
    

    
     PROCEDURAL

     
      
       This is a noise word.
      

     
    

    
     type_name

     
      
       The name of the data type of the transform.
      

     
    

    
     lang_name

     
      
       The name of the language of the transform.
      

     
    
   
  

 

 
  
# Examples

  
   To update the hstore extension to version 2.0:

```

ALTER EXTENSION hstore UPDATE TO '2.0';

```

  

  
   To change the schema of the hstore extension
   to utils:

```

ALTER EXTENSION hstore SET SCHEMA utils;

```

  

  
   To add an existing function to the hstore extension:

```

ALTER EXTENSION hstore ADD FUNCTION populate_record(anyelement, hstore);

```
