CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW

# CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW

  define a new materialized view
 

 

CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW [ IF NOT EXISTS ] table_name
    [ (column_name [, ...] ) ]
    [ USING method ]
    [ WITH ( storage_parameter [= value] [, ... ] ) ]
    [ TABLESPACE tablespace_name ]
    AS query
    [ WITH [ NO ] DATA ]

 

 
  
# Description

  
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW defines a materialized view of
   a query.  The query is executed and used to populate the view at the time
   the command is issued (unless WITH NO DATA is used) and may be
   refreshed later using REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW.
  

  
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW is similar to
   CREATE TABLE AS, except that it also remembers the query used
   to initialize the view, so that it can be refreshed later upon demand.
   A materialized view has many of the same properties as a table, but there
   is no support for temporary materialized views.
  

  
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW requires
   CREATE privilege on the schema used for the materialized
   view.
  

 

 
  
# Parameters

  
   
    IF NOT EXISTS
    
     
      Do not throw an error if a materialized view with the same name already
      exists. A notice is issued in this case.  Note that there is no guarantee
      that the existing materialized view is anything like the one that would
      have been created.
     

    
   

   
    table_name
    
     
      The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the materialized view to be
      created.  The name must be distinct from the name of any other relation
      (table, sequence, index, view, materialized view, or foreign table) in
      the same schema.
     

    
   

   
    column_name
    
     
      The name of a column in the new materialized view.  If column names are
      not provided, they are taken from the output column names of the query.
     

    
   

   
    USING method
    
     
      This optional clause specifies the table access method to use to store
      the contents for the new materialized view; the method needs be an
      access method of type TABLE. See  for more information.  If this option is not
      specified, the default table access method is chosen for the new
      materialized view. See 
      for more information.
     

    
   

   
    WITH ( storage_parameter [= value] [, ... ] )
    
     
      This clause specifies optional storage parameters for the new
      materialized view; see
       in the
       documentation for more
      information.  All parameters supported for CREATE
      TABLE are also supported for CREATE MATERIALIZED
      VIEW.
      See  for more information.
     

    
   

   
    TABLESPACE tablespace_name
    
     
      The tablespace_name is the name
      of the tablespace in which the new materialized view is to be created.
      If not specified,  is consulted.
     

    
   

   
    query
    
     
      A SELECT, TABLE,
      or VALUES command.  This query will run within a
      security-restricted operation; in particular, calls to functions that
      themselves create temporary tables will fail.  Also, while the query is
      running, the  is temporarily changed to
      pg_catalog, pg_temp.
     

    
   

   
    WITH [ NO ] DATA
    
     
      This clause specifies whether or not the materialized view should be
      populated at creation time.  If not, the materialized view will be
      flagged as unscannable and cannot be queried until REFRESH
      MATERIALIZED VIEW is used.
     

    
   

  
 

 
  
# Compatibility

  
   CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW is a
   PostgreSQL extension.
