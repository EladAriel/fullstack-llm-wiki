CREATE SERVER
 

 
  
# CREATE SERVER

  SQL - Language Statements
 

 
  
# CREATE SERVER

  define a new foreign server
 

 

CREATE SERVER [ IF NOT EXISTS ] server_name [ TYPE 'server_type' ] [ VERSION 'server_version' ]
    FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER fdw_name
    [ OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] ) ]

 

 
  
# Description

  
   CREATE SERVER defines a new foreign server.  The
   user who defines the server becomes its owner.
  

  
   A foreign server typically encapsulates connection information that
   a foreign-data wrapper uses to access an external data resource.
   Additional user-specific connection information may be specified by
   means of user mappings.
  

  
   If the foreign data wrapper fdw_name is
   specified with a CONNECTION clause, then  may use this foreign server for
   connection information.
  

  
   The server name must be unique within the database.
  

  
   Creating a server requires USAGE privilege on the
   foreign-data wrapper being used.
  

 

 
  
# Parameters

  
  
    IF NOT EXISTS
    
     
      Do not throw an error if a server with the same name already exists.
      A notice is issued in this case.  Note that there is no guarantee that
      the existing server is anything like the one that would have been
      created.
     

    
   

   
    server_name
    
     
      The name of the foreign server to be created.
     

    
   

   
    server_type
    
     
      Optional server type, potentially useful to foreign-data wrappers.
     

    
   

   
    server_version
    
     
      Optional server version, potentially useful to foreign-data wrappers.
     

    
   

   
    fdw_name
    
     
      The name of the foreign-data wrapper that manages the server.
     

    
   

   
    OPTIONS ( option 'value' [, ... ] )
    
     
      This clause specifies the options for the server.  The options
      typically define the connection details of the server, but the
      actual names and values are dependent on the server's
      foreign-data wrapper.
     

    
   
  
 

 
  
# Notes

  
   When using the  module,
   a foreign server's name can be used
   as an argument of the 
   function to indicate the connection parameters.  It is necessary to have
   the USAGE privilege on the foreign server to be
   able to use it in this way.
  

  
   If the foreign server supports sort pushdown, it is necessary for it
   to have the same sort ordering as the local server.
  

 

 
  
# Examples

  
   Create a server myserver that uses the
   foreign-data wrapper postgres_fdw:

```

CREATE SERVER myserver FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (host 'foo', dbname 'foodb', port '5432');

```

   See  for more details.
  

 

 
  
# Compatibility

  
   CREATE SERVER conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED).
