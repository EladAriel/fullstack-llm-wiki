CREATE EVENT TRIGGER
 

 
  
# CREATE EVENT TRIGGER

  7
  SQL - Language Statements
 

 
  
# CREATE EVENT TRIGGER

  define a new event trigger
 

 

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER name
    ON event
    [ WHEN filter_variable IN (filter_value [, ... ]) [ AND ... ] ]
    EXECUTE { FUNCTION | PROCEDURE } function_name()

 

 
  
# Description

  
   CREATE EVENT TRIGGER creates a new event trigger.
   Whenever the designated event occurs and the WHEN condition
   associated with the trigger, if any, is satisfied, the trigger function
   will be executed.  For a general introduction to event triggers, see
   .  The user who creates an event trigger
   becomes its owner.
  

 

 
  
# Parameters

  
   
    name
    
     
      The name to give the new trigger.  This name must be unique within
      the database.
     

    
   

   
    event
    
     
      The name of the event that triggers a call to the given function.
      See  for more information
      on event names.
     

    
   

   
    filter_variable
    
     
      The name of a variable used to filter events.  This makes it possible
      to restrict the firing of the trigger to a subset of the cases in which
      it is supported.  Currently the only supported
      filter_variable
      is TAG.
     

    
   

   
    filter_value
    
     
      A list of values for the
      associated filter_variable
      for which the trigger should fire.  For TAG, this means a
      list of command tags (e.g., 'DROP FUNCTION').
     

    
   

   
    function_name
    
     
      A user-supplied function that is declared as taking no argument and
      returning type event_trigger.
     

     
      In the syntax of CREATE EVENT TRIGGER, the keywords
      FUNCTION and PROCEDURE are
      equivalent, but the referenced function must in any case be a function,
      not a procedure.  The use of the keyword PROCEDURE
      here is historical and deprecated.
     

    
   

  
 

 
  
# Notes

  
   Only superusers can create event triggers.
  

  
   Event triggers are disabled in single-user mode (see ) as well as when
    is set to false.
   If an erroneous event trigger disables the database so much that you can't
   even drop the trigger, restart with 
   set to false to temporarily disable event triggers, or
   in single-user mode, and you'll be able to do that.
  

 

 
  
# Examples

  
   Forbid the execution of any DDL command:

```

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION abort_any_command()
  RETURNS event_trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql
  AS $$
BEGIN
  RAISE EXCEPTION 'command % is disabled', tg_tag;
END;
$$;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER abort_ddl ON ddl_command_start
   EXECUTE FUNCTION abort_any_command();

```

 

 
  
# Compatibility

  
   There is no CREATE EVENT TRIGGER statement in the
   SQL standard.
