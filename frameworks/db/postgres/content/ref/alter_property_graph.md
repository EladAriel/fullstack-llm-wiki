# Description

  
   ALTER PROPERTY GRAPH changes the definition of an
   existing property graph.  There are several subforms:

   
    
     ADD {VERTEX|NODE|EDGE|RELATIONSHIP} TABLES
     
      
       This form adds new vertex or edge tables to the property graph, using the
       same syntax as CREATE
       PROPERTY GRAPH.
      

     
    

    
     DROP {VERTEX|NODE|EDGE|RELATIONSHIP} TABLES
     
      
       This form removes vertex or edge tables from the property graph.  (Only
       the association of the tables with the graph is removed.  The tables
       themselves are not dropped.)
      

     
    

    
     ALTER {VERTEX|NODE|EDGE|RELATIONSHIP} TABLE ... ADD LABEL
     
      
       This form adds a new label to an existing vertex or edge table, using
       the same syntax as CREATE PROPERTY
       GRAPH.
      

     
    

    
     ALTER {VERTEX|NODE|EDGE|RELATIONSHIP} TABLE ... DROP LABEL
     
      
       This form removes a label from an existing vertex or edge table.  The
       last label on an element table cannot be dropped; every vertex or edge
       table must have at least one label.
      

     
    

    
     ALTER {VERTEX|NODE|EDGE|RELATIONSHIP} TABLE ... ALTER LABEL ... ADD PROPERTIES
     
      
       This form adds new properties to an existing label on an existing
       vertex or edge table.
      

     
    

    
     ALTER {VERTEX|NODE|EDGE|RELATIONSHIP} TABLE ... ALTER LABEL ... DROP PROPERTIES
     
      
       This form removes properties from an existing label on an existing
       vertex or edge table.
      

     
    

    
     OWNER
     
      
       This form changes the owner of the property graph to the specified user.
      

     
    

    
     RENAME
     
      
       This form changes the name of a property graph.
      

     
    

    
     SET SCHEMA
     
      
       This form moves the property graph into another schema.
      

     
    
   
  

  
   You must own the property graph to use ALTER PROPERTY
   GRAPH.  To change a property graph's schema, you must also have
   CREATE privilege on the new schema.  To alter the owner,
   you must be able to SET ROLE to the new owning role, and
   that role must have CREATE privilege on the property
   graph's schema.  (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner
   doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the property
   graph.  However, a superuser can alter ownership of any property graph
   anyway.)
  

 

 
  
# Parameters

  
   
    name
    
     
      The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a property graph to be altered.
     

    
   

   
    IF EXISTS
    
     
      Do not throw an error if the property graph does not exist.  A notice is
      issued in this case.
     

    
   

   
    vertex_table_definition
    edge_table_definition
    
     
      See CREATE PROPERTY
      GRAPH.
     

    
   

   
    vertex_table_alias
    edge_table_alias
    
     
      The alias of an existing vertex or edge table to operate on.  (Note that
      the alias is potentially different from the name of the underlying
      table, if the vertex or edge table was created with AS
      alias.)
     

    
   

   
    label_name
    property_name
    expression
    
     
      See CREATE PROPERTY
      GRAPH.
     

    
   

   
    new_owner
    
     
      The user name of the new owner of the property graph.
     

    
   

   
    new_name
    
     
      The new name for the property graph.
     

    
   

   
    new_schema
    
     
      The new schema for the property graph.
     

    
   
  
 

 
  
# Notes

  
   The consistency checks on a property graph described at  must be maintained by
   ALTER PROPERTY GRAPH operations.  In some cases, it
   might be necessary to make multiple alterations in a single command to
   satisfy the checks.
  

 

 
  
# Examples

  

```

ALTER PROPERTY GRAPH g1 ADD VERTEX TABLES (v2);

ALTER PROPERTY GRAPH g1 ALTER VERTEX TABLE v1 DROP LABEL foo;

ALTER PROPERTY GRAPH g1 RENAME TO g2;

```

 

 
  
# Compatibility

  
   ALTER PROPERTY GRAPH conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-16
   (SQL/PGQ).
