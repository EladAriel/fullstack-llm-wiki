ALTER CONVERSION

ALTER CONVERSION
7
SQL - Language Statements

ALTER CONVERSION
change the definition of a conversion

```
ALTER CONVERSION name RENAME TO new_name
ALTER CONVERSION name OWNER TO { new_owner | CURRENT_ROLE | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
ALTER CONVERSION name SET SCHEMA new_schema
```

## Description

`ALTER CONVERSION` changes the definition of a conversion.

You must own the conversion to use `ALTER CONVERSION`. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the conversion's schema. (These restrictions enforce that altering the owner doesn't do anything you couldn't do by dropping and recreating the conversion. However, a superuser can alter ownership of any conversion anyway.)

## Parameters

- The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing conversion.
- The new name of the conversion.
- The new owner of the conversion.
- The new schema for the conversion.

## Examples

To rename the conversion `iso_8859_1_to_utf8` to `latin1_to_unicode`:

```
ALTER CONVERSION iso_8859_1_to_utf8 RENAME TO latin1_to_unicode;
```

To change the owner of the conversion `iso_8859_1_to_utf8` to `joe`:

```
ALTER CONVERSION iso_8859_1_to_utf8 OWNER TO joe;
```

## Compatibility

There is no `ALTER CONVERSION` statement in the SQL standard.
