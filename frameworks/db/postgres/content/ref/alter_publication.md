## Description

The command `ALTER PUBLICATION` can change the attributes of a publication.

The first two variants modify which tables/schemas are part of the publication. The `ADD` and `DROP` clauses will add and remove one or more tables/schemas from the publication.

The third variant either modifies the included tables/schemas or marks the publication as `FOR ALL SEQUENCES` or `FOR ALL TABLES`, optionally using `EXCEPT` to exclude specific tables. The `SET ALL TABLES` clause can transform an empty publication, or one defined for `ALL SEQUENCES` (or both `ALL TABLES` and `ALL SEQUENCES`), into a publication defined for ALL TABLES. Likewise, `SET ALL SEQUENCES` can convert an empty publication, or one defined for `ALL TABLES` (or both `ALL TABLES` and `ALL SEQUENCES`), into a publication defined for `ALL SEQUENCES`. In addition, `SET ALL TABLES` can be used to update the tables specified in the `EXCEPT` clause of a `FOR ALL TABLES` publication. If `EXCEPT` is specified with a list of tables, the existing exclusion list is replaced with the specified tables. If `EXCEPT` is omitted, the existing exclusion list is cleared. The `SET` clause, when used with a publication defined with `FOR TABLE` or `FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA`, replaces the list of tables/schemas in the publication with the specified list; the existing tables or schemas that were present in the publication will be removed.

Note that adding tables/except tables/schemas to a publication that is already subscribed to will require an ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION action on the subscribing side in order to become effective. Likewise altering a publication to set `ALL TABLES` or to set or unset `ALL SEQUENCES` also requires the subscriber to refresh the publication. Note also that `DROP TABLES IN SCHEMA` will not drop any schema tables that were specified using FOR TABLE/ `ADD TABLE`.

The fourth variant of this command listed in the synopsis can change all of the publication properties specified in `sql-createpublication`. Properties not mentioned in the command retain their previous settings.

The remaining variants change the owner and the name of the publication.

You must own the publication to use `ALTER PUBLICATION`. Adding a table to a publication additionally requires owning that table. The `ADD TABLES IN SCHEMA`, `SET TABLES IN SCHEMA`, `SET ALL TABLES`, and `SET ALL SEQUENCES` to a publication requires the invoking user to be a superuser. To alter the owner, you must be able to `SET ROLE` to the new owning role, and that role must have `CREATE` privilege on the database. Also, the new owner of a FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA or FOR ALL TABLES or FOR ALL SEQUENCES publication must be a superuser. However, a superuser can change the ownership of a publication regardless of these restrictions.

Adding/Setting any schema when the publication also publishes a table with a column list, and vice versa is not supported.

## Parameters

- The name of an existing publication whose definition is to be altered.
- Name of an existing table. If `ONLY` is specified before the table name, only that table is affected. If `ONLY` is not specified, the table and all its descendant tables (if any) are affected. Optionally, `*` can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included. Optionally, a column list can be specified. See `sql-createpublication` for details. Note that a subscription having several publications in which the same table has been published with different column lists is not supported. See `logical-replication-col-list-combining` for details of potential problems when altering column lists. If the optional `WHERE` clause is specified, rows for which the `expression` evaluates to false or null will not be published. Note that parentheses are required around the expression. The `expression` is evaluated with the role used for the replication connection.
- Name of an existing schema.
- This clause alters publication parameters originally set by `sql-createpublication`. See there for more information. This clause is not applicable to sequences. Altering the `publish_via_partition_root` parameter can lead to data loss or duplication at the subscriber because it changes the identity and schema of the published tables. Note this happens only when a partition root table is specified as the replication target. This problem can be avoided by refraining from modifying partition leaf tables after the `ALTER PUBLICATION ... SET` until the ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION is executed and by only refreshing using the `copy_data = off` option.
- The user name of the new owner of the publication.
- The new name for the publication.

## Examples

Change the publication to publish only deletes and updates:

```
ALTER PUBLICATION noinsert SET (publish = 'update, delete');
```

Add some tables to the publication:

```
ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication ADD TABLE users (user_id, firstname), departments;
```

Change the set of columns published for a table:

```
ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication SET TABLE users (user_id, firstname, lastname), TABLE departments;
```

Replace the table list in the publication's `EXCEPT` clause:

```
ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication SET ALL TABLES EXCEPT (TABLE users, departments);
```

Reset the publication to be a `FOR ALL TABLES` publication with no excluded tables:

```
ALTER PUBLICATION mypublication SET ALL TABLES;
```

Add schemas `marketing` and `sales` to the publication `sales_publication`:

```
ALTER PUBLICATION sales_publication ADD TABLES IN SCHEMA marketing, sales;
```

Add tables `users`, `departments` and schema `production` to the publication `production_publication`:

```
ALTER PUBLICATION production_publication ADD TABLE users, departments, TABLES IN SCHEMA production;
```

## Compatibility

`ALTER PUBLICATION` is a PostgreSQL extension.
