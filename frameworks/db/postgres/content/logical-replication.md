## Logical Replication

Logical replication is a method of replicating data objects and their changes, based upon their replication identity (usually a primary key). We use the term logical replication in contrast to physical replication, which uses exact block addresses and byte-by-byte replication. PostgreSQL supports both mechanisms concurrently, see `high-availability`. Logical replication allows fine-grained control over both data replication and security.

Logical replication uses a publish and subscribe model with one or more subscribers subscribing to one or more publications on a publisher node. Subscribers pull data from the publications they subscribe to and may subsequently re-publish data to allow cascading replication or more complex configurations.

When logical replication of a table typically starts, PostgreSQL takes a snapshot of the table's data on the publisher database and copies it to the subscriber. Once complete, changes on the publisher since the initial copy are sent continually to the subscriber. The subscriber applies the data in the same order as the publisher so that transactional consistency is guaranteed for publications within a single subscription. This method of data replication is sometimes referred to as transactional replication.

The typical use-cases for logical replication are: - Sending incremental changes in a single database or a subset of a database to subscribers as they occur. - Sending a subset of the database to multiple databases (i.e., broadcast). - Consolidating multiple databases into a single one (e.g., for analytics). - Replicating between different major versions of PostgreSQL. - Replicating between PostgreSQL instances on different platforms (for example Linux to Windows). - Giving access to replicated data to different groups of users. - Firing triggers for individual changes as they arrive on the subscriber.

The subscriber database behaves in the same way as any other PostgreSQL instance and can be used as a publisher for other databases by defining its own publications. When the subscriber is treated as read-only by an application, there will be no conflicts from a single subscription. On the other hand, if there are other writes done either by an application or by other subscribers to the same set of tables, conflicts can arise.

## Publication

A publication can be defined on any physical replication primary. The node where a publication is defined is referred to as publisher. A publication is a set of changes generated from a table, a group of tables or the current state of all sequences, and might also be described as a change set or replication set. Each publication exists in only one database.

Publications are different from schemas and do not affect how the table is accessed. Each table can be added to multiple publications if needed. Publications may currently only contain tables or sequences. Objects must be added explicitly, except when a publication is created using `FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA`, `FOR ALL TABLES`, or `FOR ALL SEQUENCES`. Unlike tables, sequences can be synchronized at any time. For more information, see `logical-replication-sequences`. When a publication is created with `FOR ALL TABLES`, a table or set of tables can be explicitly excluded from publication using the EXCEPT clause.

Publications can choose to limit the changes they produce to any combination of `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE`, similar to how triggers are fired by particular event types. By default, all operation types are replicated. These publication specifications apply only for DML operations; they do not affect the initial data synchronization copy. (Row filters have no effect for `TRUNCATE`. See `logical-replication-row-filter`).

Every publication can have multiple subscribers.

A publication is created using the CREATE PUBLICATION command and may later be altered or dropped using corresponding commands.

The individual tables can be added and removed dynamically using ALTER PUBLICATION. Both the `ADD TABLE` and `DROP TABLE` operations are transactional, so the table will start or stop replicating at the correct snapshot once the transaction has committed.

## Replica Identity

A published table must have a replica identity configured in order to be able to replicate `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations, so that appropriate rows to update or delete can be identified on the subscriber side.

By default, this is the primary key, if there is one. Another unique index (with certain additional requirements) can also be set to be the replica identity. If the table does not have any suitable key, then it can be set to replica identity `FULL`, which means the entire row becomes the key. When replica identity `FULL` is specified, indexes can be used on the subscriber side for searching the rows. Candidate indexes must be btree or hash, non-partial, and the leftmost index field must be a column (not an expression) that references the published table column. These restrictions on the non-unique index properties adhere to some of the restrictions that are enforced for primary keys. If there are no such suitable indexes, the search on the subscriber side can be very inefficient, therefore replica identity `FULL` should only be used as a fallback if no other solution is possible.

If a replica identity other than `FULL` is set on the publisher side, a replica identity comprising the same or fewer columns must also be set on the subscriber side.

Tables with a replica identity defined as `NOTHING`, `DEFAULT` without a primary key, or `USING INDEX` with a dropped index, cannot support `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations when included in a publication replicating these actions. Attempting such operations will result in an error on the publisher.

`INSERT` operations can proceed regardless of any replica identity.

See ALTER TABLE...REPLICA IDENTITY for details on how to set the replica identity.

## Subscription

A subscription is the downstream side of logical replication. The node where a subscription is defined is referred to as the subscriber. A subscription defines the connection to another database and the set of publications (one or more) to which it wants to subscribe.

The subscriber database behaves in the same way as any other PostgreSQL instance and can be used as a publisher for other databases by defining its own publications.

A subscriber node may have multiple subscriptions if desired. It is possible to define multiple subscriptions between a single publisher-subscriber pair, in which case care must be taken to ensure that the subscribed publication objects don't overlap.

By default a new subscription creates a logical replication slot on the publisher and then uses this slot to track relevant transaction activity and preserve necessary WAL (see `streaming-replication-slots`). Additional replication slots may be required for the initial data synchronization of pre-existing table data and those will be dropped at the end of data synchronization.

A logical replication subscription can be a standby for synchronous replication (see `synchronous-replication`). The standby name is by default the subscription name. An alternative name can be specified as `application_name` in the connection information of the subscription.

Subscriptions are dumped by `pg_dump` if the current user is a superuser. Otherwise a warning is written and subscriptions are skipped, because non-superusers cannot read all subscription information from the `pg_subscription` catalog.

The subscription is added using CREATE SUBSCRIPTION and can be stopped/resumed at any time using the ALTER SUBSCRIPTION command and removed using DROP SUBSCRIPTION.

When a subscription is dropped and recreated, the synchronization information is lost. This means that the data has to be resynchronized afterwards.

The schema definitions are not replicated, and the published tables must exist on the subscriber. Only regular tables may be the target of replication. For example, you can't replicate to a view.

The tables are matched between the publisher and the subscriber using the fully qualified table name. Replication to differently-named tables on the subscriber is not supported.

Columns of a table are also matched by name. The order of columns in the subscriber table does not need to match that of the publisher. The data types of the columns do not need to match, as long as the text representation of the data can be converted to the target type. For example, you can replicate from a column of type `integer` to a column of type `bigint`. The target table can also have additional columns not provided by the published table. Any such columns will be filled with the default value as specified in the definition of the target table. However, logical replication in binary format is more restrictive. See the binary option of `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` for details.

## Logical Replication Slot Management

As mentioned earlier, each (active) subscription uses a logical replication slot on the remote (publishing) side.

Additional table synchronization slots are normally transient, created internally to perform initial table synchronization and dropped automatically when they are no longer needed. These table synchronization slots have generated names: `pg_%u_sync_%u_%llu` (parameters: Subscription `oid`, Table `relid`, system identifier `sysid`)

Normally, the remote logical replication slot is created automatically when the subscription is created using CREATE SUBSCRIPTION and it is dropped automatically when the subscription is dropped using DROP SUBSCRIPTION. In some situations, however, it can be useful or necessary to manipulate the subscription and the underlying replication slot separately. Here are some scenarios: - When creating a subscription, the replication slot already exists. In that case, the subscription can be created using the `create_slot = false` option to associate with the existing slot. - When creating a subscription, the remote host is not reachable or in an unclear state. In that case, the subscription can be created using the `connect = false` option. The remote host will then not be contacted at all. This is what `pg_dump` uses. The remote replication slot will then have to be created manually before the subscription can be activated. - When dropping a subscription, the replication slot should be kept. This could be useful when the subscriber database is being moved to a different host and will be activated from there. In that case, disassociate the slot from the subscription using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION before attempting to drop the subscription. - When dropping a subscription, the remote host is not reachable. In that case, disassociate the slot from the subscription using `ALTER SUBSCRIPTION` before attempting to drop the subscription. If the remote database instance no longer exists, no further action is then necessary. If, however, the remote database instance is just unreachable, the replication slot (and any still remaining table synchronization slots) should then be dropped manually; otherwise it/they would continue to reserve WAL and might eventually cause the disk to fill up. Such cases should be carefully investigated.

## Examples: Set Up Logical Replication

Create some test tables on the publisher.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE t1(a int, b text, PRIMARY KEY(a));
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE t2(c int, d text, PRIMARY KEY(c));
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE t3(e int, f text, PRIMARY KEY(e));
```

Create the same tables on the subscriber.

```
/* sub # */ CREATE TABLE t1(a int, b text, PRIMARY KEY(a));
/* sub # */ CREATE TABLE t2(c int, d text, PRIMARY KEY(c));
/* sub # */ CREATE TABLE t3(e int, f text, PRIMARY KEY(e));
```

Insert data to the tables at the publisher side.

```
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1, 'A'), (2, 'B'), (3, 'C');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t3 VALUES (1, 'i'), (2, 'ii'), (3, 'iii');
```

Create publications for the tables. The publications `pub2` and `pub3a` disallow some publish operations. The publication `pub3b` has a row filter (see `logical-replication-row-filter`).

```
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION pub1 FOR TABLE t1;
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION pub2 FOR TABLE t2 WITH (publish = 'truncate');
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION pub3a FOR TABLE t3 WITH (publish = 'truncate');
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION pub3b FOR TABLE t3 WHERE (e > 5);
```

Create subscriptions for the publications. The subscription `sub3` subscribes to both `pub3a` and `pub3b`. All subscriptions will copy initial data by default.

```
/* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub1
/* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub application_name=sub1'
/* sub - */ PUBLICATION pub1;
/* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub2
/* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub application_name=sub2'
/* sub - */ PUBLICATION pub2;
/* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub3
/* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub application_name=sub3'
/* sub - */ PUBLICATION pub3a, pub3b;
```

Observe that initial table data is copied, regardless of the `publish` operation of the publication.

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
 3 | three
(3 rows)

/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t2;
 c | d
---+---
 1 | A
 2 | B
 3 | C
(3 rows)
```

Furthermore, because the initial data copy ignores the `publish` operation, and because publication `pub3a` has no row filter, it means the copied table `t3` contains all rows even when they do not match the row filter of publication `pub3b`.

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t3;
 e |  f
---+-----
 1 | i
 2 | ii
 3 | iii
(3 rows)
```

Insert more data to the tables at the publisher side.

```
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (4, 'four'), (5, 'five'), (6, 'six');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (4, 'D'), (5, 'E'), (6, 'F');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t3 VALUES (4, 'iv'), (5, 'v'), (6, 'vi');
```

Now the publisher side data looks like:

```
/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
 3 | three
 4 | four
 5 | five
 6 | six
(6 rows)

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM t2;
 c | d
---+---
 1 | A
 2 | B
 3 | C
 4 | D
 5 | E
 6 | F
(6 rows)

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM t3;
 e |  f
---+-----
 1 | i
 2 | ii
 3 | iii
 4 | iv
 5 | v
 6 | vi
(6 rows)
```

Observe that during normal replication the appropriate `publish` operations are used. This means publications `pub2` and `pub3a` will not replicate the `INSERT`. Also, publication `pub3b` will only replicate data that matches the row filter of `pub3b`. Now the subscriber side data looks like:

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
 a |   b
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
 3 | three
 4 | four
 5 | five
 6 | six
(6 rows)

/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t2;
 c | d
---+---
 1 | A
 2 | B
 3 | C
(3 rows)

/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t3;
 e |  f
---+-----
 1 | i
 2 | ii
 3 | iii
 6 | vi
(4 rows)
```

## Examples: Deferred Logical Replication Slot Creation

There are some cases (e.g. `logical-replication-subscription-slot`) where, if the remote logical replication slot was not created automatically, the user must create it manually before the subscription can be activated. The steps to create the slot and activate the subscription are shown in the following examples. These examples specify the standard logical decoding output plugin (`logicaldecoding-pgoutput`), which is what the built-in logical replication uses.

First, create a publication for the examples to use.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION pub1 FOR ALL TABLES;
```

Example 1: Where the subscription says `connect = false`

- Create the subscription. ``` /* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub1 /* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub' /* sub - */ PUBLICATION pub1 /* sub - */ WITH (connect=false); WARNING: subscription was created, but is not connected HINT: To initiate replication, you must manually create the replication slot, enable the subscription, and refresh the subscription. ``` - On the publisher, manually create a slot. Because the name was not specified during `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION`, the name of the slot to create is same as the subscription name, e.g. "sub1". ``` /* pub # */ SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('sub1', 'pgoutput'); slot_name | lsn -----------+------------ sub1 | 0/019404D0 (1 row) ``` - On the subscriber, complete the activation of the subscription. After this the tables of `pub1` will start replicating. ``` /* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1 ENABLE; /* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1 REFRESH PUBLICATION; ```

 

Example 2: Where the subscription says `connect = false`, but also specifies the slot_name option. - Create the subscription. ``` /* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub1 /* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub' /* sub - */ PUBLICATION pub1 /* sub - */ WITH (connect=false, slot_name='myslot'); WARNING: subscription was created, but is not connected HINT: To initiate replication, you must manually create the replication slot, enable the subscription, and refresh the subscription. ``` - On the publisher, manually create a slot using the same name that was specified during `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION`, e.g. "myslot". ``` /* pub # */ SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('myslot', 'pgoutput'); slot_name | lsn -----------+------------ myslot | 0/019059A0 (1 row) ``` - On the subscriber, the remaining subscription activation steps are the same as before. ``` /* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1 ENABLE; /* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1 REFRESH PUBLICATION; ```

 

Example 3: Where the subscription specifies `slot_name = NONE` - Create the subscription. When `slot_name = NONE` then `enabled = false`, and `create_slot = false` are also needed. ``` /* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub1 /* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub' /* sub - */ PUBLICATION pub1 /* sub - */ WITH (slot_name=NONE, enabled=false, create_slot=false); ``` - On the publisher, manually create a slot using any name, e.g. "myslot". ``` /* pub # */ SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('myslot', 'pgoutput'); slot_name | lsn -----------+------------ myslot | 0/01905930 (1 row) ``` - On the subscriber, associate the subscription with the slot name just created. ``` /* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1 SET (slot_name='myslot'); ``` - The remaining subscription activation steps are same as before. ``` /* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1 ENABLE; /* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1 REFRESH PUBLICATION; ```

 

 

 

 

## Logical Replication Failover

 

To allow subscriber nodes to continue replicating data from the publisher node even when the publisher node goes down, there must be a physical standby corresponding to the publisher node. The logical slots on the primary server corresponding to the subscriptions can be synchronized to the standby server by specifying `failover = true` when creating subscriptions. See `logicaldecoding-replication-slots-synchronization` for details. Enabling the failover parameter ensures a seamless transition of those subscriptions after the standby is promoted. They can continue subscribing to publications on the new primary server.

 

Because the slot synchronization logic copies asynchronously, it is necessary to confirm that replication slots have been synced to the standby server before the failover happens. To ensure a successful failover, the standby server must be ahead of the subscriber. This can be achieved by configuring synchronized_standby_slots.

 

To confirm that the standby server is indeed ready for failover for a given subscriber, follow these steps to verify that all the logical replication slots required by that subscriber have been synchronized to the standby server:

 
 
 

On the subscriber node, use the following SQL to identify which replication slots should be synced to the standby that we plan to promote. This query will return the relevant replication slots associated with the failover-enabled subscriptions.

```
/* sub # */ SELECT
array_agg(quote_literal(s.subslotname)) AS slots
FROM pg_subscription s
WHERE s.subfailover AND
s.subslotname IS NOT NULL;
slots
-------
{'sub1','sub2','sub3'}
(1 row)
```

 
 
 

On the subscriber node, use the following SQL to identify which table synchronization slots should be synced to the standby that we plan to promote. This query needs to be run on each database that includes the failover-enabled subscription(s). Note that the table sync slot should be synced to the standby server only if the table copy is finished (See `catalog-pg-subscription-rel`). We don't need to ensure that the table sync slots are synced in other scenarios as they will either be dropped or re-created on the new primary server in those cases.

```
/* sub # */ SELECT
array_agg(quote_literal(slot_name)) AS slots
FROM
(
SELECT CONCAT('pg_', srsubid, '_sync_', srrelid, '_', ctl.system_identifier) AS slot_name
FROM pg_control_system() ctl, pg_subscription_rel r, pg_subscription s
WHERE r.srsubstate = 'f' AND s.oid = r.srsubid AND s.subfailover
);
slots
-------
{'pg_16394_sync_16385_7394666715149055164'}
(1 row)
```

 
 
 

Check that the logical replication slots identified above exist on the standby server and are ready for failover.

```
/* standby # */ SELECT slot_name, (synced AND NOT temporary AND invalidation_reason IS NULL) AS failover_ready
FROM pg_replication_slots
WHERE slot_name IN
('sub1','sub2','sub3', 'pg_16394_sync_16385_7394666715149055164');
slot_name | failover_ready
--------------------------------------------+----------------
sub1 | t
sub2 | t
sub3 | t
pg_16394_sync_16385_7394666715149055164 | t
(4 rows)
```

 
 

 

If all the slots are present on the standby server and the result (`failover_ready`) of the above SQL query is true, then existing subscriptions can continue subscribing to publications on the new primary server.

 

The first two steps in the above procedure are meant for a PostgreSQL subscriber. It is recommended to run these steps on each subscriber node, that will be served by the designated standby after failover, to obtain the complete list of replication slots. This list can then be verified in Step 3 to ensure failover readiness. Non-PostgreSQL subscribers, on the other hand, may use their own methods to identify the replication slots used by their respective subscriptions.

 

In some cases, such as during a planned failover, it is necessary to confirm that all subscribers, whether PostgreSQL or non-PostgreSQL, will be able to continue replication after failover to a given standby server. In such cases, use the following SQL, instead of performing the first two steps above, to identify which replication slots on the primary need to be synced to the standby that is intended for promotion. This query returns the relevant replication slots associated with all the failover-enabled subscriptions.

 

```
/* primary # */ SELECT array_agg(quote_literal(r.slot_name)) AS slots
FROM pg_replication_slots r
WHERE r.failover AND NOT r.temporary;
slots
-------
{'sub1','sub2','sub3', 'pg_16394_sync_16385_7394666715149055164'}
(1 row)
```

 

 

 

## Row Filters

 

By default, all data from all published tables will be replicated to the appropriate subscribers. The replicated data can be reduced by using a row filter. A user might choose to use row filters for behavioral, security or performance reasons. If a published table sets a row filter, a row is replicated only if its data satisfies the row filter expression. This allows a set of tables to be partially replicated. The row filter is defined per table. Use a `WHERE` clause after the table name for each published table that requires data to be filtered out. The `WHERE` clause must be enclosed by parentheses. See `sql-createpublication` for details.

 

 

## Row Filter Rules

 

Row filters are applied before publishing the changes. If the row filter evaluates to `false` or `NULL` then the row is not replicated. The `WHERE` clause expression is evaluated with the same role used for the replication connection (i.e. the role specified in the CONNECTION clause of the `sql-createsubscription`). Row filters have no effect for `TRUNCATE` command.

 

 

 

## Expression Restrictions

 

The `WHERE` clause allows only simple expressions. It cannot contain user-defined functions, operators, types, and collations, system column references or non-immutable built-in functions.

 

If a publication publishes `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations, the row filter `WHERE` clause must contain only columns that are covered by the replica identity (see `sql-altertable-replica-identity`). If a publication publishes only `INSERT` operations, the row filter `WHERE` clause can use any column.

 

 

 

## UPDATE Transformations

 

Whenever an `UPDATE` is processed, the row filter expression is evaluated for both the old and new row (i.e. using the data before and after the update). If both evaluations are `true`, it replicates the `UPDATE` change. If both evaluations are `false`, it doesn't replicate the change. If only one of the old/new rows matches the row filter expression, the `UPDATE` is transformed to `INSERT` or `DELETE`, to avoid any data inconsistency. The row on the subscriber should reflect what is defined by the row filter expression on the publisher.

 

If the old row satisfies the row filter expression (it was sent to the subscriber) but the new row doesn't, then, from a data consistency perspective the old row should be removed from the subscriber. So the `UPDATE` is transformed into a `DELETE`.

 

If the old row doesn't satisfy the row filter expression (it wasn't sent to the subscriber) but the new row does, then, from a data consistency perspective the new row should be added to the subscriber. So the `UPDATE` is transformed into an `INSERT`.

 

`logical-replication-row-filter-transformations-summary` summarizes the applied transformations.

## Partitioned Tables

 

If the publication contains a partitioned table, the publication parameter publish_via_partition_root determines which row filter is used. If `publish_via_partition_root` is `true`, the root partitioned table's row filter is used. Otherwise, if `publish_via_partition_root` is `false` (default), each partition's row filter is used.

 

 

 

## Initial Data Synchronization

 

If the subscription requires copying pre-existing table data and a publication contains `WHERE` clauses, only data that satisfies the row filter expressions is copied to the subscriber.

 

If the subscription has several publications in which a table has been published with different `WHERE` clauses, rows that satisfy any of the expressions will be copied. See `logical-replication-row-filter-combining` for details.

 

Because initial data synchronization does not take into account the publish parameter when copying existing table data, some rows may be copied that would not be replicated using DML. Refer to `logical-replication-snapshot`, and see `logical-replication-subscription-examples` for examples.

 

If the subscriber is in a release prior to 15, copying pre-existing data doesn't use row filters even if they are defined in the publication. This is because old releases can only copy the entire table data.

 

 

 

## Combining Multiple Row Filters

 

If the subscription has several publications in which the same table has been published with different row filters (for the same publish operation), those expressions get ORed together, so that rows satisfying any of the expressions will be replicated. This means all the other row filters for the same table become redundant if: - One of the publications has no row filter. - One of the publications was created using FOR ALL TABLES. This clause does not allow row filters. - One of the publications was created using FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA and the table belongs to the referred schema. This clause does not allow row filters.

 

 

 

## Examples

 

Create some tables to be used in the following examples.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE t1(a int, b int, c text, PRIMARY KEY(a,c));
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE t2(d int, e int, f int, PRIMARY KEY(d));
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE t3(g int, h int, i int, PRIMARY KEY(g));
```

 

Create some publications. Publication `p1` has one table (`t1`) and that table has a row filter. Publication `p2` has two tables. Table `t1` has no row filter, and table `t2` has a row filter. Publication `p3` has two tables, and both of them have a row filter.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION p1 FOR TABLE t1 WHERE (a > 5 AND c = 'NSW');
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION p2 FOR TABLE t1, t2 WHERE (e = 99);
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION p3 FOR TABLE t2 WHERE (d = 10), t3 WHERE (g = 10);
```

 

`psql` can be used to show the row filter expressions (if defined) for each publication.

```
/* pub # */ \dRp+
Publication p1
Owner | All tables | All sequences | Inserts | Updates | Deletes | Truncates | Generated columns | Via root
----------+------------+---------------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+-------------------+----------
postgres | f | f | t | t | t | t | none | f
Tables:
"public.t1" WHERE ((a > 5) AND (c = 'NSW'::text))

Publication p2
Owner | All tables | All sequences | Inserts | Updates | Deletes | Truncates | Generated columns | Via root
----------+------------+---------------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+-------------------+----------
postgres | f | f | t | t | t | t | none | f
Tables:
"public.t1"
"public.t2" WHERE (e = 99)

Publication p3
Owner | All tables | All sequences | Inserts | Updates | Deletes | Truncates | Generated columns | Via root
----------+------------+---------------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+-------------------+----------
postgres | f | f | t | t | t | t | none | f
Tables:
"public.t2" WHERE (d = 10)
"public.t3" WHERE (g = 10)
```

 

`psql` can be used to show the row filter expressions (if defined) for each table. See that table `t1` is a member of two publications, but has a row filter only in `p1`. See that table `t2` is a member of two publications, and has a different row filter in each of them.

"t3_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (g)
Included in publications:
"p3" WHERE (g = 10)
```

 

On the subscriber node, create a table `t1` with the same definition as the one on the publisher, and also create the subscription `s1` that subscribes to the publication `p1`.

```
/* sub # */ CREATE TABLE t1(a int, b int, c text, PRIMARY KEY(a,c));
/* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION s1
/* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub application_name=s1'
/* sub - */ PUBLICATION p1;
```

 

Insert some rows. Only the rows satisfying the `t1 WHERE` clause of publication `p1` are replicated.

```
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (2, 102, 'NSW');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (3, 103, 'QLD');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (4, 104, 'VIC');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (5, 105, 'ACT');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (6, 106, 'NSW');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (7, 107, 'NT');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (8, 108, 'QLD');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (9, 109, 'NSW');

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
a | b | c
---+-----+-----
2 | 102 | NSW
3 | 103 | QLD
4 | 104 | VIC
5 | 105 | ACT
6 | 106 | NSW
7 | 107 | NT
8 | 108 | QLD
9 | 109 | NSW
(8 rows)
```

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
a | b | c
---+-----+-----
6 | 106 | NSW
9 | 109 | NSW
(2 rows)
```

 

Update some data, where the old and new row values both satisfy the `t1 WHERE` clause of publication `p1`. The `UPDATE` replicates the change as normal.

```
/* pub # */ UPDATE t1 SET b = 999 WHERE a = 6;

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
a | b | c
---+-----+-----
2 | 102 | NSW
3 | 103 | QLD
4 | 104 | VIC
5 | 105 | ACT
7 | 107 | NT
8 | 108 | QLD
9 | 109 | NSW
6 | 999 | NSW
(8 rows)
```

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
a | b | c
---+-----+-----
9 | 109 | NSW
6 | 999 | NSW
(2 rows)
```

 

Update some data, where the old row values did not satisfy the `t1 WHERE` clause of publication `p1`, but the new row values do satisfy it. The `UPDATE` is transformed into an `INSERT` and the change is replicated. See the new row on the subscriber.

```
/* pub # */ UPDATE t1 SET a = 555 WHERE a = 2;

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
a | b | c
-----+-----+-----
3 | 103 | QLD
4 | 104 | VIC
5 | 105 | ACT
7 | 107 | NT
8 | 108 | QLD
9 | 109 | NSW
6 | 999 | NSW
555 | 102 | NSW
(8 rows)
```

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
a | b | c
-----+-----+-----
9 | 109 | NSW
6 | 999 | NSW
555 | 102 | NSW
(3 rows)
```

 

Update some data, where the old row values satisfied the `t1 WHERE` clause of publication `p1`, but the new row values do not satisfy it. The `UPDATE` is transformed into a `DELETE` and the change is replicated. See that the row is removed from the subscriber.

```
/* pub # */ UPDATE t1 SET c = 'VIC' WHERE a = 9;

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
a | b | c
-----+-----+-----
3 | 103 | QLD
4 | 104 | VIC
5 | 105 | ACT
7 | 107 | NT
8 | 108 | QLD
6 | 999 | NSW
555 | 102 | NSW
9 | 109 | VIC
(8 rows)
```

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t1;
a | b | c
-----+-----+-----
6 | 999 | NSW
555 | 102 | NSW
(2 rows)
```

 

The following examples show how the publication parameter publish_via_partition_root determines whether the row filter of the parent or child table will be used in the case of partitioned tables.

 

Create a partitioned table on the publisher.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE parent(a int PRIMARY KEY) PARTITION BY RANGE(a);
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE child PARTITION OF parent DEFAULT;
```

Create the same tables on the subscriber.

```
/* sub # */ CREATE TABLE parent(a int PRIMARY KEY) PARTITION BY RANGE(a);
/* sub # */ CREATE TABLE child PARTITION OF parent DEFAULT;
```

 

Create a publication `p4`, and then subscribe to it. The publication parameter `publish_via_partition_root` is set as true. There are row filters defined on both the partitioned table (`parent`), and on the partition (`child`).

```
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION p4 FOR TABLE parent WHERE (a = 5)
/* pub - */ WITH (publish_via_partition_root=true);
```

```
/* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION s4
/* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub application_name=s4'
/* sub - */ PUBLICATION p4;
```

 

Insert some values directly into the `parent` and `child` tables. They replicate using the row filter of `parent` (because `publish_via_partition_root` is true).

```
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO parent VALUES (2), (4), (6);
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO child VALUES (3), (5), (7);

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM parent ORDER BY a;
a
---
2
3
4
5
6
7
(6 rows)
```

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM parent ORDER BY a;
a
---
2
3
4
(3 rows)
```

 

Repeat the same test, but with a different value for `publish_via_partition_root`. The publication parameter `publish_via_partition_root` is set as false. A row filter is defined on the partition (`child`).

```
/* pub # */ DROP PUBLICATION p4;
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION p4 FOR TABLE parent, child WHERE (a >= 5)
/* pub - */ WITH (publish_via_partition_root=false);
```

```
/* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION s4 REFRESH PUBLICATION;
```

 

Do the inserts on the publisher same as before. They replicate using the row filter of `child` (because `publish_via_partition_root` is false).

```
/* pub # */ TRUNCATE parent;
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO parent VALUES (2), (4), (6);
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO child VALUES (3), (5), (7);

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM parent ORDER BY a;
a
---
2
3
4
5
6
7
(6 rows)
```

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM child ORDER BY a;
a
---
5
6
7
(3 rows)
```

 

 

 

 

## Column Lists

 

Each publication can optionally specify which columns of each table are replicated to subscribers. The table on the subscriber side must have at least all the columns that are published. If no column list is specified, then all columns on the publisher are replicated. See `sql-createpublication` for details on the syntax.

 

The choice of columns can be based on behavioral or performance reasons. However, do not rely on this feature for security: a malicious subscriber is able to obtain data from columns that are not specifically published. If security is a consideration, protections can be applied at the publisher side.

 

If no column list is specified, any columns added to the table later are automatically replicated. This means that having a column list which names all columns is not the same as having no column list at all.

 

A column list can contain only simple column references. The order of columns in the list is not preserved.

 

Generated columns can also be specified in a column list. This allows generated columns to be published, regardless of the publication parameter publish_generated_columns. See `logical-replication-gencols` for details.

 

Specifying a column list when the publication also publishes FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA is not supported.

 

For partitioned tables, the publication parameter publish_via_partition_root determines which column list is used. If `publish_via_partition_root` is `true`, the root partitioned table's column list is used. Otherwise, if `publish_via_partition_root` is `false` (the default), each partition's column list is used.

 

If a publication publishes `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations, any column list must include the table's replica identity columns (see `sql-altertable-replica-identity`). If a publication publishes only `INSERT` operations, then the column list may omit replica identity columns.

 

Column lists have no effect for the `TRUNCATE` command.

 

During initial data synchronization, only the published columns are copied. However, if the subscriber is from a release prior to 15, then all the columns in the table are copied during initial data synchronization, ignoring any column lists. If the subscriber is from a release prior to 18, then initial table synchronization won't copy generated columns even if they are defined in the publisher.

 

## Warning: Combining Column Lists from Multiple Publications There's currently no support for subscriptions comprising several publications where the same table has been published with different column lists. `sql-createsubscription` disallows creating such subscriptions, but it is still possible to get into that situation by adding or altering column lists on the publication side after a subscription has been created. This means changing the column lists of tables on publications that are already subscribed could lead to errors being thrown on the subscriber side. If a subscription is affected by this problem, the only way to resume replication is to adjust one of the column lists on the publication side so that they all match; and then either recreate the subscription, or use ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DROP PUBLICATION to remove one of the offending publications and add it again.

 

 

## Examples

 

Create a table `t1` to be used in the following example.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE t1(id int, a text, b text, c text, d text, e text, PRIMARY KEY(id));
```

 

Create a publication `p1`. A column list is defined for table `t1` to reduce the number of columns that will be replicated. Notice that the order of column names in the column list does not matter.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION p1 FOR TABLE t1 (id, b, a, d);
```

 

`psql` can be used to show the column lists (if defined) for each publication.

```
/* pub # */ \dRp+
Publication p1
Owner | All tables | All sequences | Inserts | Updates | Deletes | Truncates | Generated columns | Via root
----------+------------+---------------+---------+---------+---------+-----------+-------------------+----------
postgres | f | f | t | t | t | t | none | f
Tables:
"public.t1" (id, a, b, d)
```

 

`psql` can be used to show the column lists (if defined) for each table.

```
/* pub # */ \d t1
Table "public.t1"
Column | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
id | integer | | not null |
a | text | | |
b | text | | |
c | text | | |
d | text | | |
e | text | | |
Indexes:
"t1_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (id)
Included in publications:
"p1" (id, a, b, d)
```

 

On the subscriber node, create a table `t1` which now only needs a subset of the columns that were on the publisher table `t1`, and also create the subscription `s1` that subscribes to the publication `p1`.

```
/* sub # */ CREATE TABLE t1(id int, b text, a text, d text, PRIMARY KEY(id));
/* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION s1
/* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub application_name=s1'
/* sub - */ PUBLICATION p1;
```

 

On the publisher node, insert some rows to table `t1`.

```
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(1, 'a-1', 'b-1', 'c-1', 'd-1', 'e-1');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(2, 'a-2', 'b-2', 'c-2', 'd-2', 'e-2');
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(3, 'a-3', 'b-3', 'c-3', 'd-3', 'e-3');
/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY id;
id | a | b | c | d | e
----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----
1 | a-1 | b-1 | c-1 | d-1 | e-1
2 | a-2 | b-2 | c-2 | d-2 | e-2
3 | a-3 | b-3 | c-3 | d-3 | e-3
(3 rows)
```

 

Only data from the column list of publication `p1` is replicated.

```
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM t1 ORDER BY id;
id | b | a | d
----+-----+-----+-----
1 | b-1 | a-1 | d-1
2 | b-2 | a-2 | d-2
3 | b-3 | a-3 | d-3
(3 rows)
```

 

 

 

 

## Generated Column Replication

 

Typically, a table at the subscriber will be defined the same as the publisher table, so if the publisher table has a GENERATED column then the subscriber table will have a matching generated column. In this case, it is always the subscriber table generated column value that is used.

 

For example, note below that subscriber table generated column value comes from the subscriber column's calculation.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE TABLE tab_gen_to_gen (a int, b int GENERATED ALWAYS AS (a + 1) STORED);
/* pub # */ INSERT INTO tab_gen_to_gen VALUES (1),(2),(3);
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION pub1 FOR TABLE tab_gen_to_gen;
/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM tab_gen_to_gen;
a | b
---+---
1 | 2
2 | 3
3 | 4
(3 rows)

/* sub # */ CREATE TABLE tab_gen_to_gen (a int, b int GENERATED ALWAYS AS (a * 100) STORED);
/* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub1 CONNECTION 'dbname=test_pub' PUBLICATION pub1;
/* sub # */ SELECT * FROM tab_gen_to_gen;
a | b
---+----
1 | 100
2 | 200
3 | 300
(3 rows)
```

 

In fact, prior to version 18.0, logical replication does not publish `GENERATED` columns at all.

 

But, replicating a generated column to a regular column can sometimes be desirable. This feature may be useful when replicating data to a non-PostgreSQL database via output plugin, especially if the target database does not support generated columns.

 
 

 

Generated columns are not published by default, but users can opt to publish stored generated columns just like regular ones.

 

There are two ways to do this: - Set the `PUBLICATION` parameter publish_generated_columns to `stored`. This instructs PostgreSQL logical replication to publish current and future stored generated columns of the publication's tables. - Specify a table column list to explicitly nominate which stored generated columns will be published. When determining which table columns will be published, a column list takes precedence, overriding the effect of the `publish_generated_columns` parameter.

 

The following table summarizes behavior when there are generated columns involved in the logical replication. Results are shown for when publishing generated columns is not enabled, and for when it is enabled.

There's currently no support for subscriptions comprising several publications where the same table has been published with different column lists. See `logical-replication-col-lists`. This same situation can occur if one publication is publishing generated columns, while another publication in the same subscription is not publishing generated columns for the same table.

 

If the subscriber is from a release prior to 18, then initial table synchronization won't copy generated columns even if they are defined in the publisher.

 

 

 

## Replicating Sequences

 

To synchronize sequences from a publisher to a subscriber, first publish them using CREATE PUBLICATION ... FOR ALL SEQUENCES and then on the subscriber:

 

- use CREATE SUBSCRIPTION to initially synchronize the published sequences. - use ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION to synchronize only newly added sequences. - use ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH SEQUENCES to re-synchronize all sequences currently known to the subscription.

 

A sequence synchronization worker will be started after executing any of the above subscriber commands, and will exit once the sequences are synchronized.

 

The ability to launch a sequence synchronization worker is limited by the max_sync_workers_per_subscription configuration.

 

 

## Sequence Definition Mismatches

 

The sequence synchronization worker validates that sequence definitions match between publisher and subscriber. If mismatches exist, the worker logs an error identifying them and exits. The apply worker continues respawning the sequence synchronization worker until synchronization succeeds. See also wal_retrieve_retry_interval.

 

To resolve this, use ALTER SEQUENCE to align the subscriber's sequence parameters with those of the publisher.

 

 

 

## Refreshing Out-of-Sync Sequences

 

Subscriber sequence values will become out of sync as the publisher advances them.

 

To detect this, compare the pg_subscription_rel.`srsublsn` on the subscriber with the `page_lsn` obtained from the pg_get_sequence_data function for the sequence on the publisher. Then run ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH SEQUENCES to re-synchronize if necessary.

 

Each sequence caches a block of values (typically 32) in memory before generating a new WAL record, so its LSN advances only after the entire cached batch has been consumed. As a result, sequence value drift cannot be detected by LSN comparison when sequence increments fall within the same cached block (typically 32 values).

 

 

 

## Examples

 

Create some sequences on the publisher.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE SEQUENCE s1 START WITH 10 INCREMENT BY 1;
/* pub # */ CREATE SEQUENCE s2 START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 10;
```

 

Create the same sequences on the subscriber.

```
/* sub # */ CREATE SEQUENCE s1 START WITH 10 INCREMENT BY 1;
/* sub # */ CREATE SEQUENCE s2 START WITH 100 INCREMENT BY 10;
```

 

Advance the sequences on the publisher a few times.

```
/* pub # */ SELECT nextval('s1');
nextval
---------
10
(1 row)
/* pub # */ SELECT nextval('s1');
nextval
---------
11
(1 row)
/* pub # */ SELECT nextval('s2');
nextval
---------
100
(1 row)
/* pub # */ SELECT nextval('s2');
nextval
---------
110
(1 row)
```

 

Check the sequence page LSNs on the publisher.

```
/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM pg_get_sequence_data('s1');
last_value | is_called | page_lsn
------------+-----------+------------
11 | t | 0/0178F9E0
(1 row)
/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM pg_get_sequence_data('s2');
last_value | is_called | page_lsn
------------+-----------+------------
110 | t | 0/0178FAB0
(1 row)
```

 

Create a publication for the sequences.

```
/* pub # */ CREATE PUBLICATION pub1 FOR ALL SEQUENCES;
```

 

Subscribe to the publication.

```
/* sub # */ CREATE SUBSCRIPTION sub1
/* sub - */ CONNECTION 'host=localhost dbname=test_pub application_name=sub1'
/* sub - */ PUBLICATION pub1;
```

 

Verify that the initial sequence values are synchronized.

```
/* sub # */ SELECT last_value, is_called FROM s1;
last_value | is_called
------------+-----------
11 | t
(1 row)

/* sub # */ SELECT last_value, is_called FROM s2;
last_value | is_called
------------+-----------
110 | t
(1 row)
```

 

Confirm that the sequence page LSNs on the publisher have been recorded on the subscriber.

```
/* sub # */ SELECT srrelid::regclass, srsublsn FROM pg_subscription_rel;
srrelid | srsublsn
---------+------------
s1 | 0/0178F9E0
s2 | 0/0178FAB0
(2 rows)
```

 

Advance the sequences on the publisher 50 more times.

```
/* pub # */ SELECT nextval('s1') FROM generate_series(1,50);
/* pub # */ SELECT nextval('s2') FROM generate_series(1,50);
```

 

Check the sequence page LSNs on the publisher.

```
/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM pg_get_sequence_data('s1');
last_value | is_called | page_lsn
------------+-----------+------------
61 | t | 0/017CED28
(1 row)

/* pub # */ SELECT * FROM pg_get_sequence_data('s2');
last_value | is_called | page_lsn
------------+-----------+------------
610 | t | 0/017CEDF8
(1 row)
```

 

The difference between the sequence page LSNs on the publisher and the sequence page LSNs on the subscriber indicates that the sequences are out of sync. Re-synchronize all sequences known to the subscriber using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH SEQUENCES.

```
/* sub # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1 REFRESH SEQUENCES;
```

 

Recheck the sequences on the subscriber.

```
/* sub # */ SELECT last_value, is_called FROM s1;
last_value | is_called
------------+-----------
61 | t
(1 row)

/* sub # */ SELECT last_value, is_called FROM s2;
last_value | is_called
------------+-----------
610 | t
(1 row)
```

 

 

 

 

## Conflicts

 

Logical replication behaves similarly to normal DML operations in that the data will be updated even if it was changed locally on the subscriber node. If incoming data violates any constraints the replication will stop. This is referred to as a conflict. When replicating `UPDATE` or `DELETE` operations, missing data is also considered as a conflict, but does not result in an error and such operations will simply be skipped.

 

Additional logging is triggered, and the conflict statistics are collected (displayed in the pg_stat_subscription_stats view) in the following conflict cases: - Inserting a row that violates a `NOT DEFERRABLE` unique constraint. Note that to log the origin and commit timestamp details of the conflicting key, track_commit_timestamp should be enabled on the subscriber. In this case, an error will be raised until the conflict is resolved manually. - Updating a row that was previously modified by another origin. Note that this conflict can only be detected when track_commit_timestamp is enabled on the subscriber. Currently, the update is always applied regardless of the origin of the local row. - The updated value of a row violates a `NOT DEFERRABLE` unique constraint. Note that to log the origin and commit timestamp details of the conflicting key, track_commit_timestamp should be enabled on the subscriber. In this case, an error will be raised until the conflict is resolved manually. Note that when updating a partitioned table, if the updated row value satisfies another partition constraint resulting in the row being inserted into a new partition, the `insert_exists` conflict may arise if the new row violates a `NOT DEFERRABLE` unique constraint. - The tuple to be updated was concurrently deleted by another origin. The update will simply be skipped in this scenario. Note that this conflict can only be detected when track_commit_timestamp and retain_dead_tuples are enabled. Note that if a tuple cannot be found due to the table being truncated, only a `update_missing` conflict will arise. Additionally, if the tuple was deleted by the same origin, an `update_missing` conflict will arise. - The row to be updated was not found. The update will simply be skipped in this scenario. - Deleting a row that was previously modified by another origin. Note that this conflict can only be detected when track_commit_timestamp is enabled on the subscriber. Currently, the delete is always applied regardless of the origin of the local row. - The row to be deleted was not found. The delete will simply be skipped in this scenario. - Inserting or updating a row violates multiple `NOT DEFERRABLE` unique constraints. Note that to log the origin and commit timestamp details of conflicting keys, ensure that track_commit_timestamp is enabled on the subscriber. In this case, an error will be raised until the conflict is resolved manually. Note that there are other conflict scenarios, such as exclusion constraint violations. Currently, we do not provide additional details for them in the log.

 

The log format for logical replication conflicts is as follows:

```
LOG: conflict detected on relation "schemaname.tablename": conflict=conflict_type
DETAIL: detailed_explanation[: detail_values [, ... ]].

where detail_values is one of:

key (column_name , ...)=(column_value , ...)
local row (column_name , ...)=(column_value , ...)
remote row (column_name , ...)=(column_value , ...)
replica identity {(column_name , ...)=(column_value , ...) | full (column_name , ...)=(column_value , ...)}
```

The log provides the following information: - - `schemaname`.`tablename` identifies the local relation involved in the conflict. - `conflict_type` is the type of conflict that occurred (e.g., `insert_exists`, `update_exists`). - - `detailed_explanation` includes the origin, transaction ID, and commit timestamp of the transaction that modified the local row, if available. - The `key` section includes the key values of the local row that violated a unique constraint for `insert_exists`, `update_exists` or `multiple_unique_conflicts` conflicts. - The `local row` section includes the local row if its origin differs from the remote row for `update_origin_differs` or `delete_origin_differs` conflicts, or if the key value conflicts with the remote row for `insert_exists`, `update_exists` or `multiple_unique_conflicts` conflicts. - The `remote row` section includes the new row from the remote insert or update operation that caused the conflict. Note that for an update operation, the column value of the new row will be null if the value is unchanged and toasted. - The `replica identity` section includes the replica identity key values that were used to search for the existing local row to be updated or deleted. This may include the full row value if the local relation is marked with REPLICA IDENTITY FULL. - `column_name` is the column name. For `local row`, `remote row`, and `replica identity full` cases, column names are logged only if the user lacks the privilege to access all columns of the table. If column names are present, they appear in the same order as the corresponding column values. - `column_value` is the column value. The large column values are truncated to 64 bytes. - Note that in case of `multiple_unique_conflicts` conflict, multiple `detailed_explanation` and `detail_values` lines will be generated, each detailing the conflict information associated with distinct unique constraints.

 

Logical replication operations are performed with the privileges of the role which owns the subscription. Permissions failures on target tables will cause replication conflicts, as will enabled row-level security on target tables that the subscription owner is subject to, without regard to whether any policy would ordinarily reject the `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` or `TRUNCATE` which is being replicated. This restriction on row-level security may be lifted in a future version of PostgreSQL.

 

A conflict that produces an error will stop the replication; it must be resolved manually by the user. Details about the conflict can be found in the subscriber's server log.

 

The resolution can be done either by changing data or permissions on the subscriber so that it does not conflict with the incoming change or by skipping the transaction that conflicts with the existing data. When a conflict produces an error, the replication won't proceed, and the logical replication worker will emit the following kind of message to the subscriber's server log:

```
ERROR: conflict detected on relation "public.test": conflict=insert_exists
DETAIL: Could not apply remote change: remote row (1, 'remote').
Key already exists in unique index "test_pkey", modified locally in transaction 800 at 2026-01-16 18:15:25.652759+09: key (c)=(1), local row (1, 'local').
CONTEXT: processing remote data for replication origin "pg_16395" during "INSERT" for replication target relation "public.test" in transaction 725 finished at 0/014C0378
```

The LSN of the transaction that contains the change violating the constraint and the replication origin name can be found from the server log (LSN 0/014C0378 and replication origin `pg_16395` in the above case). The transaction that produced the conflict can be skipped by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... SKIP with the finish LSN (i.e., LSN 0/014C0378). The finish LSN could be an LSN at which the transaction is committed or prepared on the publisher. Alternatively, the transaction can also be skipped by calling the pg_replication_origin_advance() function. Before using this function, the subscription needs to be disabled temporarily either by ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DISABLE or, the subscription can be used with the disable_on_error option. Then, you can use `pg_replication_origin_advance()` function with the `node_name` (i.e., `pg_16395`) and the next LSN of the finish LSN (i.e., 0/014C0379). The current position of origins can be seen in the pg_replication_origin_status system view. Please note that skipping the whole transaction includes skipping changes that might not violate any constraint. This can easily make the subscriber inconsistent. The additional details regarding conflicting rows, such as their origin and commit timestamp can be seen in the `DETAIL` line of the log. But note that this information is only available when track_commit_timestamp is enabled on the subscriber. Users can use this information to decide whether to retain the local change or adopt the remote alteration. For instance, the `DETAIL` line in the above log indicates that the existing row was modified locally. Users can manually perform a remote-change-win.

 

When the streaming mode is `parallel`, the finish LSN of failed transactions may not be logged. In that case, it may be necessary to change the streaming mode to `on` or `off` and cause the same conflicts again so the finish LSN of the failed transaction will be written to the server log. For the usage of finish LSN, please refer to ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... SKIP.

 

 

 

## Restrictions

 

Logical replication currently has the following restrictions or missing functionality. These might be addressed in future releases.

 

- The database schema and DDL commands are not replicated. The initial schema can be copied by hand using `pg_dump --schema-only`. Subsequent schema changes would need to be kept in sync manually. (Note, however, that there is no need for the schemas to be absolutely the same on both sides.) Logical replication is robust when schema definitions change in a live database: When the schema is changed on the publisher and replicated data starts arriving at the subscriber but does not fit into the table schema, replication will error until the schema is updated. In many cases, intermittent errors can be avoided by applying additive schema changes to the subscriber first.
- Incremental sequence changes are not replicated. Although the data in serial or identity columns backed by sequences will be replicated as part of the table, the sequences themselves do not replicate ongoing changes. On the subscriber, a sequence will retain the last value it synchronized from the publisher. If the subscriber is used as a read-only database, then this should typically not be a problem. If, however, some kind of switchover or failover to the subscriber database is intended, then the sequences would need to be updated to the latest values, either by executing ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH SEQUENCES or by copying the current data from the publisher (perhaps using `pg_dump`) or by determining a sufficiently high value from the tables themselves.
- Replication of `TRUNCATE` commands is supported, but some care must be taken when truncating groups of tables connected by foreign keys. When replicating a truncate action, the subscriber will truncate the same group of tables that was truncated on the publisher, either explicitly specified or implicitly collected via `CASCADE`, minus tables that are not part of the subscription. This will work correctly if all affected tables are part of the same subscription. But if some tables to be truncated on the subscriber have foreign-key links to tables that are not part of the same (or any) subscription, then the application of the truncate action on the subscriber will fail.
- Large objects (see `largeobjects`) are not replicated. There is no workaround for that, other than storing data in normal tables.
- Replication is only supported by tables, including partitioned tables. Attempts to replicate other types of relations, such as views, materialized views, or foreign tables, will result in an error.
- When replicating between partitioned tables, the actual replication originates, by default, from the leaf partitions on the publisher, so partitions on the publisher must also exist on the subscriber as valid target tables. (They could either be leaf partitions themselves, or they could be further subpartitioned, or they could even be independent tables.) Publications can also specify that changes are to be replicated using the identity and schema of the partitioned root table instead of that of the individual leaf partitions in which the changes actually originate (see publish_via_partition_root parameter of `CREATE PUBLICATION`).
- When using REPLICA IDENTITY FULL on published tables, it is important to note that the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations cannot be applied to subscribers if the tables include attributes with datatypes (such as point or box) that do not have a default operator class for B-tree or Hash. However, this limitation can be overcome by ensuring that the table has a primary key or replica identity defined for it.

 

 

 

## Architecture

 

Logical replication is built with an architecture similar to physical streaming replication (see `streaming-replication`). It is implemented by `walsender` and `apply` processes. The walsender process starts logical decoding (described in `logicaldecoding`) of the WAL and loads the standard logical decoding output plugin (`logicaldecoding-pgoutput`). The plugin transforms the changes read from WAL to the logical replication protocol (see `protocol-logical-replication`) and filters the data according to the publication specification. The data is then continuously transferred using the streaming replication protocol to the apply worker, which maps the data to local tables and applies the individual changes as they are received, in correct transactional order.

 

The apply process on the subscriber database always runs with session_replication_role set to `replica`. This means that, by default, triggers and rules will not fire on a subscriber. Users can optionally choose to enable triggers and rules on a table using the ALTER TABLE command and the `ENABLE TRIGGER` and `ENABLE RULE` clauses.

 

The logical replication apply process currently only fires row triggers, not statement triggers. The initial table synchronization, however, is implemented like a `COPY` command and thus fires both row and statement triggers for `INSERT`.

 

 

## Initial Snapshot

 

The initial data in existing subscribed tables is snapshotted and copied in parallel instances of a special kind of apply process. These special apply processes are dedicated table synchronization workers, spawned for each table to be synchronized. Each table synchronization process will create its own replication slot and copy the existing data. As soon as the copy is finished the table contents will become visible to other backends. Once existing data is copied, the worker enters synchronization mode, which ensures that the table is brought up to a synchronized state with the main apply process by streaming any changes that happened during the initial data copy using standard logical replication. During this synchronization phase, the changes are applied and committed in the same order as they happened on the publisher. Once synchronization is done, control of the replication of the table is given back to the main apply process where replication continues as normal.

 

The publication publish parameter only affects what DML operations will be replicated. The initial data synchronization does not take this parameter into account when copying the existing table data.

 

If a table synchronization worker fails during copy, the apply worker detects the failure and respawns the table synchronization worker to continue the synchronization process. This behaviour ensures that transient errors do not permanently disrupt the replication setup. See also wal_retrieve_retry_interval.

 

 

 

 

## Monitoring

 

Because streaming logical replication is based on a similar architecture as streaming physical replication, the monitoring on a publication node is similar to monitoring of a physical replication primary (see `streaming-replication-monitoring`).

 

The monitoring information about subscription is visible in pg_stat_subscription. This view contains one row for every subscription worker. A subscription can have zero or more active subscription workers depending on its state.

 

Normally, there is a single apply process running for an enabled subscription. A disabled subscription or a crashed subscription will have zero rows in this view. If the initial data synchronization of any table is in progress, there will be additional workers for the tables being synchronized. Moreover, if the streaming transaction is applied in parallel, there may be additional parallel apply workers.

 

 

 

## Security

 

The role used for the replication connection must have the `REPLICATION` attribute (or be a superuser). If the role lacks `SUPERUSER` and `BYPASSRLS`, publisher row security policies can execute. If the role does not trust all table owners, include `options=-crow_security=off` in the connection string; if a table owner then adds a row security policy, that setting will cause replication to halt rather than execute the policy. Access for the role must be configured in `pg_hba.conf` and it must have the `LOGIN` attribute.

 

In order to be able to copy the initial table or sequence data, the role used for the replication connection must have the `SELECT` privilege on a published table or sequence (or be a superuser).

 

To create a publication, the user must have the `CREATE` privilege in the database.

 

To create a publication using `FOR TABLE`, the user must have ownership rights on all the listed tables. To create a publication using any of `FOR ALL TABLES`, `FOR ALL SEQUENCES`, or `FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA`, the user must be a superuser. To alter a publication using `ADD TABLE`, the user must have ownership rights on all the listed tables. To alter a publication using `ADD TABLES IN SCHEMA`, the user must be a superuser.

 

There are currently no privileges on publications. Any subscription (that is able to connect) can access any publication. Thus, if you intend to hide some information from particular subscribers, such as by using row filters or column lists, or by not adding the whole table to the publication, be aware that other publications in the same database could expose the same information. Publication privileges might be added to PostgreSQL in the future to allow for finer-grained access control.

 

To create a subscription, the user must have the privileges of the `pg_create_subscription` role, as well as `CREATE` privileges on the database. If `SERVER` is specified, the user also must have `USAGE` privileges on the server.

 

The subscription apply process will, at a session level, run with the privileges of the subscription owner. However, when performing an insert, update, delete, or truncate operation on a particular table, it will switch roles to the table owner and perform the operation with the table owner's privileges. Similarly, when synchronizing sequence data, it will switch to the sequence owner's role and perform the operation using the sequence owner's privileges. This means that the subscription owner needs to be able to `SET ROLE` to each role that owns a replicated table or sequence.

 

If the subscription has been configured with `run_as_owner = true`, then no user switching will occur. Instead, all operations will be performed with the permissions of the subscription owner. In this case, the subscription owner only needs privileges to `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` from the target table, and does not need privileges to `SET ROLE` to the table owner. However, this also means that any user who owns a table into which replication is happening can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the subscription owner. For example, they could do this by simply attaching a trigger to one of the tables which they own. Because it is usually undesirable to allow one role to freely assume the privileges of another, this option should be avoided unless user security within the database is of no concern.

 

On the publisher, privileges are only checked once at the start of a replication connection and are not re-checked as each change record is read.

 

On the subscriber, the subscription owner's privileges are re-checked for each transaction when applied. If a worker is in the process of applying a transaction when the ownership of the subscription is changed by a concurrent transaction, the application of the current transaction will continue under the old owner's privileges.

 

 

 

## Configuration Settings

 

Logical replication requires several configuration options to be set. These options are relevant only on one side of the replication.

 

 

## Publishers

 

wal_level must be set to `replica` or `logical`.

 

max_replication_slots must be set to at least the number of subscriptions expected to connect, plus some reserve for table synchronization.

 

Logical replication slots are also affected by idle_replication_slot_timeout.

 

max_wal_senders should be set to at least the same as `max_replication_slots`, plus the number of physical replicas that are connected at the same time.

 

Logical replication walsender is also affected by wal_sender_timeout.

 

 

 

## Subscribers

 

max_active_replication_origins must be set to at least the number of subscriptions that will be added to the subscriber, plus some reserve for table synchronization.

 

max_replication_slots must be set to at least 1 when retain_dead_tuples is enabled for any subscription.

 

max_logical_replication_workers must be set to at least the number of subscriptions (for leader apply workers), plus some reserve for the parallel apply workers, and table/sequence synchronization workers.

 

max_worker_processes may need to be adjusted to accommodate for replication workers, at least (max_logical_replication_workers + `1`). Note, some extensions and parallel queries also take worker slots from `max_worker_processes`.

 

max_sync_workers_per_subscription controls how many tables can be synchronized in parallel during subscription initialization or when new tables are added. One additional worker is also needed for sequence synchronization.

 

max_parallel_apply_workers_per_subscription controls the amount of parallelism for streaming of in-progress transactions with subscription parameter `streaming = parallel`.

 

Logical replication workers are also affected by wal_receiver_timeout, wal_receiver_status_interval and wal_retrieve_retry_interval.

 

 

 

 

## Upgrade

 

Migration of logical replication clusters is possible only when all the members of the old logical replication clusters are version 17.0 or later.

 

 

## Prepare for Publisher Upgrades

 

`pg_upgrade` attempts to migrate logical slots. This helps avoid the need for manually defining the same logical slots on the new publisher. Migration of logical slots is only supported when the old cluster is version 17.0 or later. Logical slots on clusters before version 17.0 will silently be ignored.

 

Before you start upgrading the publisher cluster, ensure that the subscription is temporarily disabled, by executing ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DISABLE. Re-enable the subscription after the upgrade.

 

There are some prerequisites for `pg_upgrade` to be able to upgrade the logical slots. If these are not met an error will be reported.

 

- The new cluster must have wal_level as `replica` or `logical`.
- The new cluster must have max_replication_slots configured to a value greater than or equal to the number of slots present in the old cluster.
- The output plugins referenced by the slots on the old cluster must be installed in the new PostgreSQL executable directory.
- The old cluster has replicated all the transactions and logical decoding messages to subscribers.
- All slots on the old cluster must be usable, i.e., their pg_replication_slots.`conflicting` is `false`.
- The new cluster must not have any permanent logical slots; i.e., any existing logical slots must have pg_replication_slots.`temporary` set to `true`.

 

 

 

## Prepare for Subscriber Upgrades

 

Setup the subscriber configurations in the new subscriber. `pg_upgrade` attempts to migrate subscription dependencies which includes the subscription's table information present in pg_subscription_rel system catalog and also the subscription's replication origin. This allows logical replication on the new subscriber to continue from where the old subscriber was up to. Migration of subscription dependencies is only supported when the old cluster is version 17.0 or later. Subscription dependencies on clusters before version 17.0 will silently be ignored.

 

Commit timestamps and origin data are not preserved during the upgrade. As a result, even if retain_dead_tuples is enabled, the upgraded subscriber may be unable to detect conflicts or log relevant commit timestamps and origins when applying changes from the publisher occurred before the upgrade. Additionally, immediately after the upgrade, the vacuum may remove the deleted rows that are required for conflict detection. This can affect the changes that were not replicated before the upgrade. To ensure consistent conflict tracking, users should ensure that all potentially conflicting changes are replicated to the subscriber before initiating the upgrade.

 

There are some prerequisites for `pg_upgrade` to be able to upgrade the subscriptions. If these are not met an error will be reported.

 

- All the subscription tables in the old subscriber should be in state `i` (initialize) or `r` (ready). This can be verified by checking pg_subscription_rel.`srsubstate`.
- The replication origin entry corresponding to each of the subscriptions should exist in the old cluster. This can be found by checking pg_subscription and pg_replication_origin system tables.
- The new cluster must have max_active_replication_origins configured to a value greater than or equal to the number of subscriptions present in the old cluster.
- If there are subscriptions with retain_dead_tuples enabled, the reserved replication slot `pg_conflict_detection` must not exist on the new cluster. Additionally, the wal_level on the new cluster must be set to `replica` or `logical`.

 

 

 

## Upgrading Logical Replication Clusters

 

While upgrading a subscriber, write operations can be performed in the publisher. These changes will be replicated to the subscriber once the subscriber upgrade is completed.

 

The logical replication restrictions apply to logical replication cluster upgrades also. See `logical-replication-restrictions` for details. The prerequisites of publisher upgrade apply to logical replication cluster upgrades also. See `prepare-publisher-upgrades` for details. The prerequisites of subscriber upgrade apply to logical replication cluster upgrades also. See `prepare-subscriber-upgrades` for details.

 

Upgrading logical replication cluster requires multiple steps to be performed on various nodes. Because not all operations are transactional, the user is advised to take backups as described in `backup-base-backup`.

 

The steps to upgrade the following logical replication clusters are detailed below: - Follow the steps specified in `steps-two-node-logical-replication-cluster` to upgrade a two-node logical replication cluster. - Follow the steps specified in `steps-cascaded-logical-replication-cluster` to upgrade a cascaded logical replication cluster. - Follow the steps specified in `steps-two-node-circular-logical-replication-cluster` to upgrade a two-node circular logical replication cluster.

 

 

## Steps to Upgrade a Two-node Logical Replication Cluster

 

Let's say publisher is in `node1` and subscriber is in `node2`. The subscriber `node2` has a subscription `sub1_node1_node2` which is subscribing the changes from `node1`.

 
 
 

Disable all the subscriptions on `node2` that are subscribing the changes from `node1` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DISABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 DISABLE;
```

 
 
 

Stop the publisher server in `node1`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data1 stop
```

 

 
 

Initialize `data1_upgraded` instance by using the required newer version.

 

 
 

Upgrade the publisher `node1`'s server to the required newer version, e.g.:

```
pg_upgrade
--old-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/data1"
--new-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/data1_upgraded"
--old-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/bin"
--new-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/bin"
```

 

 
 

Start the upgraded publisher server in `node1`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data1_upgraded start -l logfile
```

 

 
 

Stop the subscriber server in `node2`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data2 stop
```

 

 
 

Initialize `data2_upgraded` instance by using the required newer version.

 

 
 

Upgrade the subscriber `node2`'s server to the required new version, e.g.:

```
pg_upgrade
--old-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/data2"
--new-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/data2_upgraded"
--old-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/bin"
--new-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/bin"
```

 

 
 

Start the upgraded subscriber server in `node2`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data2_upgraded start -l logfile
```

 

 
 

On `node2`, create any tables that were created in the upgraded publisher `node1` server between `two-node-cluster-disable-subscriptions-node2` and now, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ CREATE TABLE distributors (did integer PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(40));
```

 

 
 

Enable all the subscriptions on `node2` that are subscribing the changes from `node1` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... ENABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 ENABLE;
```

 

 
 

Refresh the `node2` subscription's publications using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 REFRESH PUBLICATION;
```

 
 

 

In the steps described above, the publisher is upgraded first, followed by the subscriber. Alternatively, the user can use similar steps to upgrade the subscriber first, followed by the publisher.

 

 

 

## Steps to Upgrade a Cascaded Logical Replication Cluster

 

Let's say we have a cascaded logical replication setup `node1`->`node2`->`node3`. Here `node2` is subscribing the changes from `node1` and `node3` is subscribing the changes from `node2`. The `node2` has a subscription `sub1_node1_node2` which is subscribing the changes from `node1`. The `node3` has a subscription `sub1_node2_node3` which is subscribing the changes from `node2`.

 
 
 

Disable all the subscriptions on `node2` that are subscribing the changes from `node1` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DISABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 DISABLE;
```

 

 
 

Stop the server in `node1`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data1 stop
```

 

 
 

Initialize `data1_upgraded` instance by using the required newer version.

 

 
 

Upgrade the `node1`'s server to the required newer version, e.g.:

--new-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/bin"
```

 

 
 

Start the upgraded server in `node1`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data1_upgraded start -l logfile
```

 

 
 

Disable all the subscriptions on `node3` that are subscribing the changes from `node2` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DISABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node3 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node2_node3 DISABLE;
```

 

 
 

Stop the server in `node2`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data2 stop
```

 

 
 

Initialize `data2_upgraded` instance by using the required newer version.

 

 
 

Upgrade the `node2`'s server to the required new version, e.g.:

--new-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/data2_upgraded"
--old-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/bin"
--new-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/bin"
```

 

 
 

Start the upgraded server in `node2`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data2_upgraded start -l logfile
```

 

 
 

On `node2`, create any tables that were created in the upgraded publisher `node1` server between `cascaded-cluster-disable-sub-node1-node2` and now, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ CREATE TABLE distributors (did integer PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(40));
```

 

 
 

Enable all the subscriptions on `node2` that are subscribing the changes from `node1` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... ENABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 ENABLE;
```

 

 
 

Refresh the `node2` subscription's publications using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 REFRESH PUBLICATION;
```

 

 
 

Stop the server in `node3`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data3 stop
```

 

 
 

Initialize `data3_upgraded` instance by using the required newer version.

 

 
 

Upgrade the `node3`'s server to the required new version, e.g.:

```
pg_upgrade
--old-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/data3"
--new-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/data3_upgraded"
--old-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/bin"
--new-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/bin"
```

 

 
 

Start the upgraded server in `node3`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data3_upgraded start -l logfile
```

 

 
 

On `node3`, create any tables that were created in the upgraded `node2` between `cascaded-cluster-disable-sub-node2-node3` and now, e.g.:

```
/* node3 # */ CREATE TABLE distributors (did integer PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(40));
```

 

 
 

Enable all the subscriptions on `node3` that are subscribing the changes from `node2` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... ENABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node3 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node2_node3 ENABLE;
```

 

 
 

Refresh the `node3` subscription's publications using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION, e.g.:

```
/* node3 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node2_node3 REFRESH PUBLICATION;
```

 
 
 

 

 

## Steps to Upgrade a Two-node Circular Logical Replication Cluster

 

Let's say we have a circular logical replication setup `node1`->`node2` and `node2`->`node1`. Here `node2` is subscribing the changes from `node1` and `node1` is subscribing the changes from `node2`. The `node1` has a subscription `sub1_node2_node1` which is subscribing the changes from `node2`. The `node2` has a subscription `sub1_node1_node2` which is subscribing the changes from `node1`.

 
 
 

Disable all the subscriptions on `node2` that are subscribing the changes from `node1` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DISABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 DISABLE;
```

 

 
 

Stop the server in `node1`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data1 stop
```

 

 
 

Initialize `data1_upgraded` instance by using the required newer version.

 

 
 

Upgrade the `node1`'s server to the required newer version, e.g.:

```
pg_upgrade
--old-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/data1"
--new-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/data1_upgraded"
--old-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/bin"
--new-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/bin"
```

 

 
 

Start the upgraded server in `node1`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data1_upgraded start -l logfile
```

 

 
 

Enable all the subscriptions on `node2` that are subscribing the changes from `node1` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... ENABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 ENABLE;
```

 

 
 

On `node1`, create any tables that were created in `node2` between `circular-cluster-disable-sub-node2` and now, e.g.:

```
/* node1 # */ CREATE TABLE distributors (did integer PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(40));
```

 

 
 

Refresh the `node1` subscription's publications to copy initial table data from `node2` using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION, e.g.:

```
/* node1 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node2_node1 REFRESH PUBLICATION;
```

 

 
 

Disable all the subscriptions on `node1` that are subscribing the changes from `node2` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... DISABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node1 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node2_node1 DISABLE;
```

 

 
 

Stop the server in `node2`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data2 stop
```

 

 
 

Initialize `data2_upgraded` instance by using the required newer version.

 

 
 

Upgrade the `node2`'s server to the required new version, e.g.:

```
pg_upgrade
--old-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/data2"
--new-datadir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/data2_upgraded"
--old-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/17/bin"
--new-bindir "/opt/PostgreSQL/postgres/18/bin"
```

 

 
 

Start the upgraded server in `node2`, e.g.:

```
pg_ctl -D /opt/PostgreSQL/data2_upgraded start -l logfile
```

 

 
 

Enable all the subscriptions on `node1` that are subscribing the changes from `node2` by using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... ENABLE, e.g.:

```
/* node1 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node2_node1 ENABLE;
```

 

 
 

On `node2`, create any tables that were created in the upgraded `node1` between `circular-cluster-disable-sub-node1` and now, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ CREATE TABLE distributors (did integer PRIMARY KEY, name varchar(40));
```

 

 
 

Refresh the `node2` subscription's publications to copy initial table data from `node1` using ALTER SUBSCRIPTION ... REFRESH PUBLICATION, e.g.:

```
/* node2 # */ ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub1_node1_node2 REFRESH PUBLICATION;
```

 
 
 

 

 

 

 

## Quick Setup

 

First set the configuration options in `postgresql.conf`:

```
wal_level = logical
```

The other required settings have default values that are sufficient for a basic setup.

 

`pg_hba.conf` needs to be adjusted to allow replication (the values here depend on your actual network configuration and user you want to use for connecting):

```
host all repuser 0.0.0.0/0 scram-sha-256
```

 

Then on the publisher database:

```
CREATE PUBLICATION mypub FOR TABLE users, departments;
```

 

And on the subscriber database:

```
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION mysub CONNECTION 'dbname=foo host=bar user=repuser' PUBLICATION mypub;
```

The above will start the replication process, which synchronizes the initial table contents of the tables `users` and `departments` and then starts replicating incremental changes to those tables.
