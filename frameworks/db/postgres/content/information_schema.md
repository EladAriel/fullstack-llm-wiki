## The Information Schema

information schema

The information schema consists of a set of views that contain information about the objects defined in the current database. The information schema is defined in the SQL standard and can therefore be expected to be portable and remain stable -- unlike the system catalogs, which are specific to PostgreSQL and are modeled after implementation concerns. The information schema views do not, however, contain information about PostgreSQL-specific features; to inquire about those you need to query the system catalogs or other PostgreSQL-specific views.

When querying the database for constraint information, it is possible for a standard-compliant query that expects to return one row to return several. This is because the SQL standard requires constraint names to be unique within a schema, but PostgreSQL does not enforce this restriction. PostgreSQL automatically-generated constraint names avoid duplicates in the same schema, but users can specify such duplicate names. This problem can appear when querying information schema views such as `check_constraint_routine_usage`, `check_constraints`, `domain_constraints`, and `referential_constraints`. Some other views have similar issues but contain the table name to help distinguish duplicate rows, e.g., `constraint_column_usage`, `constraint_table_usage`, `table_constraints`.

## The Schema

The information schema itself is a schema named `information_schema`. This schema automatically exists in all databases. The owner of this schema is the initial database user in the cluster, and that user naturally has all the privileges on this schema, including the ability to drop it (but the space savings achieved by that are minuscule).

By default, the information schema is not in the schema search path, so you need to access all objects in it through qualified names. Since the names of some of the objects in the information schema are generic names that might occur in user applications, you should be careful if you want to put the information schema in the path.

## Data Types

The columns of the information schema views use special data types that are defined in the information schema. These are defined as simple domains over ordinary built-in types. You should not use these types for work outside the information schema, but your applications must be prepared for them if they select from the information schema.

These types are: - A nonnegative integer. - A character string (without specific maximum length). - A character string. This type is used for SQL identifiers, the type `character_data` is used for any other kind of text data. - A domain over the type `timestamp with time zone` - A character string domain that contains either `YES` or `NO`. This is used to represent Boolean (true/false) data in the information schema. (The information schema was invented before the type `boolean` was added to the SQL standard, so this convention is necessary to keep the information schema backward compatible.) Every column in the information schema has one of these five types.

## `information_schema_catalog_name`

`information_schema_catalog_name` is a table that always contains one row and one column containing the name of the current database (current catalog, in SQL terminology).

## `attributes`

The view `attributes` contains information about the attributes of composite data types defined in the database. (Note that the view does not give information about table columns, which are sometimes called attributes in PostgreSQL contexts.) Only those attributes are shown that the current user has access to (by way of being the owner of or having some privilege on the type).

It can be expressed in decimal (base 10) or binary (base 2) terms, as specified in the column `numeric_precision_radix`. For all other data types, this column is null.

`numeric_precision_radix` `cardinal_number`

If `data_type` identifies a numeric type, this column indicates in which base the values in the columns `numeric_precision` and `numeric_scale` are expressed. The value is either 2 or 10. For all other data types, this column is null.

`dtd_identifier` `sql_identifier`

An identifier of the data type descriptor of the attribute, unique among the data type descriptors pertaining to the composite type. This is mainly useful for joining with other instances of such identifiers. (The specific format of the identifier is not defined and not guaranteed to remain the same in future versions.)

`is_derived_reference_attribute` `yes_or_no`

Applies to a feature not available in PostgreSQL

See also under `infoschema-columns`, a similarly structured view, for further information on some of the columns.

## `character_sets`

The view `character_sets` identifies the character sets available in the current database. Since PostgreSQL does not support multiple character sets within one database, this view only shows one, which is the database encoding.

Take note of how the following terms are used in the SQL standard: - An abstract collection of characters, for example `UNICODE`, `UCS`, or `LATIN1`. Not exposed as an SQL object, but visible in this view. - An encoding of some character repertoire. Most older character repertoires only use one encoding form, and so there are no separate names for them (e.g., `LATIN2` is an encoding form applicable to the `LATIN2` repertoire). But for example Unicode has the encoding forms `UTF8`, `UTF16`, etc. (not all supported by PostgreSQL). Encoding forms are not exposed as an SQL object, but are visible in this view. - A named SQL object that identifies a character repertoire, a character encoding, and a default collation. A predefined character set would typically have the same name as an encoding form, but users could define other names. For example, the character set `UTF8` would typically identify the character repertoire `UCS`, encoding form `UTF8`, and some default collation. You can think of an encoding in PostgreSQL either as a character set or a character encoding form. They will have the same name, and there can only be one in one database.

## `character_sets` Columns

Name of the schema containing the default collation

`default_collate_name` `sql_identifier`

Since data types can be defined in a variety of ways in SQL, and PostgreSQL contains additional ways to define data types, their representation in the information schema can be somewhat difficult. The column `data_type` is supposed to identify the underlying built-in type of the column. In PostgreSQL, this means that the type is defined in the system catalog schema `pg_catalog`. This column might be useful if the application can handle the well-known built-in types specially (for example, format the numeric types differently or use the data in the precision columns). The columns `udt_name`, `udt_schema`, and `udt_catalog` always identify the underlying data type of the column, even if the column is based on a domain. (Since PostgreSQL treats built-in types like user-defined types, built-in types appear here as well. This is an extension of the SQL standard.) These columns should be used if an application wants to process data differently according to the type, because in that case it wouldn't matter if the column is really based on a domain. If the column is based on a domain, the identity of the domain is stored in the columns `domain_name`, `domain_schema`, and `domain_catalog`. If you want to pair up columns with their associated data types and treat domains as separate types, you could write `coalesce(domain_name, udt_name)`, etc.

## `constraint_column_usage`

The view `constraint_column_usage` identifies all columns in the current database that are used by some constraint. Only those columns are shown that are contained in a table owned by a currently enabled role. For a check constraint, this view identifies the columns that are used in the check expression. For a not-null constraint, this view identifies the column that the constraint is defined on. For a foreign key constraint, this view identifies the columns that the foreign key references. For a unique or primary key constraint, this view identifies the constrained columns.

## `constraint_column_usage` Columns

## `constraint_table_usage`

The view `constraint_table_usage` identifies all tables in the current database that are used by some constraint and are owned by a currently enabled role. (This is different from the view `table_constraints`, which identifies all table constraints along with the table they are defined on.) For a foreign key constraint, this view identifies the table that the foreign key references. For a unique or primary key constraint, this view simply identifies the table the constraint belongs to. Check constraints and not-null constraints are not included in this view.

## `data_type_privileges`

The view `data_type_privileges` identifies all data type descriptors that the current user has access to, by way of being the owner of the described object or having some privilege for it. A data type descriptor is generated whenever a data type is used in the definition of a table column, a domain, or a function (as parameter or return type) and stores some information about how the data type is used in that instance (for example, the declared maximum length, if applicable). Each data type descriptor is assigned an arbitrary identifier that is unique among the data type descriptor identifiers assigned for one object (table, domain, function). This view is probably not useful for applications, but it is used to define some other views in the information schema.

`numeric_scale` `cardinal_number`

If the domain has an exact numeric type, this column contains the (declared or implicit) scale of the type for this domain. The scale indicates the number of significant digits to the right of the decimal point.

`dtd_identifier` `sql_identifier`

An identifier of the data type descriptor of the domain, unique among the data type descriptors pertaining to the domain (which is trivial, because a domain only contains one data type descriptor). This is mainly useful for joining with other instances of such identifiers. (The specific format of the identifier is not defined and not guaranteed to remain the same in future versions.)

## `element_types`

The view `element_types` contains the data type descriptors of the elements of arrays. When a table column, composite-type attribute, domain, function parameter, or function return value is defined to be of an array type, the respective information schema view only contains `ARRAY` in the column `data_type`. To obtain information on the element type of the array, you can join the respective view with this view. For example, to show the columns of a table with data types and array element types, if applicable, you could do:

```
SELECT c.column_name, c.data_type, e.data_type AS element_type
FROM information_schema.columns c LEFT JOIN information_schema.element_types e
     ON ((c.table_catalog, c.table_schema, c.table_name, 'TABLE', c.dtd_identifier)
       = (e.object_catalog, e.object_schema, e.object_name, e.object_type, e.collection_type_identifier))
WHERE c.table_schema = '...' AND c.table_name = '...'
ORDER BY c.ordinal_position;
```

`with_hierarchy` `yes_or_no`

In the SQL standard, `WITH HIERARCHY OPTION` is a separate (sub-)privilege allowing certain operations on table inheritance hierarchies. In PostgreSQL, this is included in the `SELECT` privilege, so this column shows `YES` if the privilege is `SELECT`, else `NO`.

## `role_udt_grants`

The view `role_udt_grants` is intended to identify `USAGE` privileges granted on user-defined types where the grantor or grantee is a currently enabled role. Further information can be found under `udt_privileges`. The only effective difference between this view and `udt_privileges` is that this view omits objects that have been made accessible to the current user by way of a grant to `PUBLIC`.

The view `routine_routine_usage` identifies all functions or procedures that are used by another (or the same) function or procedure, either in the SQL body or in parameter default expressions. (This only works for unquoted SQL bodies, not quoted bodies or functions in other languages.) An entry is included here only if the used function is owned by a currently enabled role. (There is no such restriction on the using function.)

Note that the entries for both functions in the view refer to the specific name of the routine, even though the column names are used in a way that is inconsistent with other information schema views about routines. This is per SQL standard, although it is arguably a misdesign. See `infoschema-routines` for more information about specific names.

Triggers in PostgreSQL have two incompatibilities with the SQL standard that affect the representation in the information schema. First, trigger names are local to each table in PostgreSQL, rather than being independent schema objects. Therefore there can be duplicate trigger names defined in one schema, so long as they belong to different tables. (`trigger_catalog` and `trigger_schema` are really the values pertaining to the table that the trigger is defined on.) Second, triggers can be defined to fire on multiple events in PostgreSQL (e.g., `ON INSERT OR UPDATE`), whereas the SQL standard only allows one. If a trigger is defined to fire on multiple events, it is represented as multiple rows in the information schema, one for each type of event. As a consequence of these two issues, the primary key of the view `triggers` is really `(trigger_catalog, trigger_schema, event_object_table, trigger_name, event_manipulation)` instead of `(trigger_catalog, trigger_schema, trigger_name)`, which is what the SQL standard specifies. Nonetheless, if you define your triggers in a manner that conforms with the SQL standard (trigger names unique in the schema and only one event type per trigger), this will not affect you.

Prior to PostgreSQL 9.1, this view's columns `action_timing`, `action_reference_old_table`, `action_reference_new_table`, `action_reference_old_row`, and `action_reference_new_row` were named `condition_timing`, `condition_reference_old_table`, `condition_reference_new_table`, `condition_reference_old_row`, and `condition_reference_new_row` respectively. That was how they were named in the SQL:1999 standard. The new naming conforms to SQL:2003 and later.

## `udt_privileges`

The view `udt_privileges` identifies `USAGE` privileges granted on user-defined types to a currently enabled role or by a currently enabled role. There is one row for each combination of type, grantor, and grantee. This view shows only composite types (see under `infoschema-user-defined-types` for why); see `infoschema-usage-privileges` for domain privileges.

## `udt_privileges` Columns

## `usage_privileges`

The view `usage_privileges` identifies `USAGE` privileges granted on various kinds of objects to a currently enabled role or by a currently enabled role. In PostgreSQL, this currently applies to collations, domains, foreign-data wrappers, foreign servers, and sequences. There is one row for each combination of object, grantor, and grantee.

Since collations do not have real privileges in PostgreSQL, this view shows implicit non-grantable `USAGE` privileges granted by the owner to `PUBLIC` for all collations. The other object types, however, show real privileges.

In PostgreSQL, sequences also support `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges in addition to the `USAGE` privilege. These are nonstandard and therefore not visible in the information schema.

## `user_defined_types`

The view `user_defined_types` currently contains all composite types defined in the current database. Only those types are shown that the current user has access to (by way of being the owner or having some privilege).

SQL knows about two kinds of user-defined types: structured types (also known as composite types in PostgreSQL) and distinct types (not implemented in PostgreSQL). To be future-proof, use the column `user_defined_type_category` to differentiate between these. Other user-defined types such as base types and enums, which are PostgreSQL extensions, are not shown here. For domains, see `infoschema-domains` instead.
