## `ECPG` -- Embedded SQL in C

embedded SQLin C
C
ECPG

This chapter describes the embedded SQL package for PostgreSQL. It was written by Linus Tolke (linus@epact.se) and Michael Meskes (meskes@postgresql.org). Originally it was written to work with C. It also works with C++, but it does not recognize all C++ constructs yet.

This documentation is quite incomplete. But since this interface is standardized, additional information can be found in many resources about SQL.

## The Concept

An embedded SQL program consists of code written in an ordinary programming language, in this case C, mixed with SQL commands in specially marked sections. To build the program, the source code (`*.pgc`) is first passed through the embedded SQL preprocessor, which converts it to an ordinary C program (`*.c`), and afterwards it can be processed by a C compiler. (For details about the compiling and linking see `ecpg-process`.) Converted ECPG applications call functions in the libpq library through the embedded SQL library (ecpglib), and communicate with the PostgreSQL server using the normal frontend-backend protocol.

Embedded SQL has advantages over other methods for handling SQL commands from C code. First, it takes care of the tedious passing of information to and from variables in your C program. Second, the SQL code in the program is checked at build time for syntactical correctness. Third, embedded SQL in C is specified in the SQL standard and supported by many other SQL database systems. The PostgreSQL implementation is designed to match this standard as much as possible, and it is usually possible to port embedded SQL programs written for other SQL databases to PostgreSQL with relative ease.

As already stated, programs written for the embedded SQL interface are normal C programs with special code inserted to perform database-related actions. This special code always has the form:

```
EXEC SQL ...;
```

These statements syntactically take the place of a C statement. Depending on the particular statement, they can appear at the global level or within a function.

Embedded SQL statements follow the case-sensitivity rules of normal SQL code, and not those of C. Also they allow nested C-style comments as per the SQL standard. The C part of the program, however, follows the C standard of not accepting nested comments. Embedded SQL statements likewise use SQL rules, not C rules, for parsing quoted strings and identifiers. (See `sql-syntax-strings` and `sql-syntax-identifiers` respectively.) Of course, the C part of the program follows C quoting rules.

The following sections explain all the embedded SQL statements.

## Managing Database Connections

This section describes how to open, close, and switch database connections.

## Connecting to the Database Server

One connects to a database using the following statement:

```
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO target AS connection-name USER user-name;
```

The `target` can be specified in the following ways: - `dbname@hostname:port` - `tcp:postgresql://hostname:port/dbname?options` - `unix:postgresql://localhost:port/dbname?options` - an SQL string literal containing one of the above forms - a reference to a character variable containing one of the above forms (see examples) - `DEFAULT` The connection target `DEFAULT` initiates a connection to the default database under the default user name. No separate user name or connection name can be specified in that case.

If you specify the connection target directly (that is, not as a string literal or variable reference), then the components of the target are passed through normal SQL parsing; this means that, for example, the `hostname` must look like one or more SQL identifiers separated by dots, and those identifiers will be case-folded unless double-quoted. Values of any `options` must be SQL identifiers, integers, or variable references. Of course, you can put nearly anything into an SQL identifier by double-quoting it. In practice, it is probably less error-prone to use a (single-quoted) string literal or a variable reference than to write the connection target directly.

There are also different ways to specify the user name: - `username` - `username/password` - `username IDENTIFIED BY password` - `username USING password` As above, the parameters `username` and `password` can be an SQL identifier, an SQL string literal, or a reference to a character variable.

If the connection target includes any `options`, those consist of `keyword=value` specifications separated by ampersands (`&`). The allowed key words are the same ones recognized by `libpq` (see `libpq-paramkeywords`). Spaces are ignored before any `keyword` or `value`, though not within or after one. Note that there is no way to write `&` within a `value`.

Notice that when specifying a socket connection (with the `unix:` prefix), the host name must be exactly `localhost`. To select a non-default socket directory, write the directory's pathname as the value of a `host` option in the `options` part of the target.

The `connection-name` is used to handle multiple connections in one program. It can be omitted if a program uses only one connection. The most recently opened connection becomes the current connection, which is used by default when an SQL statement is to be executed (see later in this chapter).

Here are some examples of `CONNECT` statements:

```
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO mydb@sql.mydomain.com;

EXEC SQL CONNECT TO tcp:postgresql://sql.mydomain.com/mydb AS myconnection USER john;

EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
const char *target = "mydb@sql.mydomain.com";
const char *user = "john";
const char *passwd = "secret";
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
 ...
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO :target USER :user USING :passwd;
/* or EXEC SQL CONNECT TO :target USER :user/:passwd; */
```

The last example makes use of the feature referred to above as character variable references. You will see in later sections how C variables can be used in SQL statements when you prefix them with a colon.

Be advised that the format of the connection target is not specified in the SQL standard. So if you want to develop portable applications, you might want to use something based on the last example above to encapsulate the connection target string somewhere.

If untrusted users have access to a database that has not adopted a secure schema usage pattern, begin each session by removing publicly-writable schemas from `search_path`. For example, add `options=-c search_path=` to `options`, or issue `EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false);` after connecting. This consideration is not specific to ECPG; it applies to every interface for executing arbitrary SQL commands.

## Choosing a Connection

SQL statements in embedded SQL programs are by default executed on the current connection, that is, the most recently opened one. If an application needs to manage multiple connections, then there are three ways to handle this.

The first option is to explicitly choose a connection for each SQL statement, for example:

```
EXEC SQL AT connection-name SELECT ...;
```

This option is particularly suitable if the application needs to use several connections in mixed order.

If your application uses multiple threads of execution, they cannot share a connection concurrently. You must either explicitly control access to the connection (using mutexes) or use a connection for each thread.

The second option is to execute a statement to switch the current connection. That statement is:

```
EXEC SQL SET CONNECTION connection-name;
```

This option is particularly convenient if many statements are to be executed on the same connection.

Here is an example program managing multiple database connections:

```
#include 

EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    char dbname[1024];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

int
main()
{
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb1 AS con1 USER testuser;
    EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb2 AS con2 USER testuser;
    EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb3 AS con3 USER testuser;
    EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;

    /* This query would be executed in the last opened database "testdb3". */
    EXEC SQL SELECT current_database() INTO :dbname;
    printf("current=%s (should be testdb3)\n", dbname);

    /* Using "AT" to run a query in "testdb2" */
    EXEC SQL AT con2 SELECT current_database() INTO :dbname;
    printf("current=%s (should be testdb2)\n", dbname);

    /* Switch the current connection to "testdb1". */
    EXEC SQL SET CONNECTION con1;

    EXEC SQL SELECT current_database() INTO :dbname;
    printf("current=%s (should be testdb1)\n", dbname);

    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT ALL;
    return 0;
}
```

This example would produce this output:

```
current=testdb3 (should be testdb3)
current=testdb2 (should be testdb2)
current=testdb1 (should be testdb1)
```

The third option is to declare an SQL identifier linked to the connection, for example:

```
EXEC SQL AT connection-name DECLARE statement-name STATEMENT;
EXEC SQL PREPARE statement-name FROM :dyn-string;
```

Once you link an SQL identifier to a connection, you execute dynamic SQL without an AT clause. Note that this option behaves like preprocessor directives, therefore the link is enabled only in the file.

Here is an example program using this option:

```
#include 

EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
char dbname[128];
char *dyn_sql = "SELECT current_database()";
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

int main(){
  EXEC SQL CONNECT TO postgres AS con1;
  EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb AS con2;
  EXEC SQL AT con1 DECLARE stmt STATEMENT;
  EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt FROM :dyn_sql;
  EXEC SQL EXECUTE stmt INTO :dbname;
  printf("%s\n", dbname);

  EXEC SQL DISCONNECT ALL;
  return 0;
}
```

This example would produce this output, even if the default connection is testdb:

```
postgres
```

## Closing a Connection

To close a connection, use the following statement:

```
EXEC SQL DISCONNECT connection;
```

The `connection` can be specified in the following ways: - `connection-name` - `CURRENT` - `ALL` If no connection name is specified, the current connection is closed.

It is good style that an application always explicitly disconnect from every connection it opened.

## Running SQL Commands

Any SQL command can be run from within an embedded SQL application. Below are some examples of how to do that.

## Executing SQL Statements

Creating a table:

```
EXEC SQL CREATE TABLE foo (number integer, ascii char(16));
EXEC SQL CREATE UNIQUE INDEX num1 ON foo(number);
EXEC SQL COMMIT;
```

Inserting rows:

```
EXEC SQL INSERT INTO foo (number, ascii) VALUES (9999, 'doodad');
EXEC SQL COMMIT;
```

Deleting rows:

```
EXEC SQL DELETE FROM foo WHERE number = 9999;
EXEC SQL COMMIT;
```

Updates:

```
EXEC SQL UPDATE foo
    SET ascii = 'foobar'
    WHERE number = 9999;
EXEC SQL COMMIT;
```

`SELECT` statements that return a single result row can also be executed using `EXEC SQL` directly. To handle result sets with multiple rows, an application has to use a cursor; see `ecpg-cursors` below. (As a special case, an application can fetch multiple rows at once into an array host variable; see `ecpg-variables-arrays`.)

Single-row select:

```
EXEC SQL SELECT foo INTO :FooBar FROM table1 WHERE ascii = 'doodad';
```

Also, a configuration parameter can be retrieved with the `SHOW` command:

```
EXEC SQL SHOW search_path INTO :var;
```

The tokens of the form `:something` are host variables, that is, they refer to variables in the C program. They are explained in `ecpg-variables`.

## Using Cursors

To retrieve a result set holding multiple rows, an application has to declare a cursor and fetch each row from the cursor. The steps to use a cursor are the following: declare a cursor, open it, fetch a row from the cursor, repeat, and finally close it.

Select using cursors:

```
EXEC SQL DECLARE foo_bar CURSOR FOR
    SELECT number, ascii FROM foo
    ORDER BY ascii;
EXEC SQL OPEN foo_bar;
EXEC SQL FETCH foo_bar INTO :FooBar, DooDad;
...
EXEC SQL CLOSE foo_bar;
EXEC SQL COMMIT;
```

For more details about declaring a cursor, see `ecpg-sql-declare`; for more details about fetching rows from a cursor, see `sql-fetch`.

The ECPG `DECLARE` command does not actually cause a statement to be sent to the PostgreSQL backend. The cursor is opened in the backend (using the backend's `DECLARE` command) at the point when the `OPEN` command is executed.

## Managing Transactions

In the default mode, statements are committed only when `EXEC SQL COMMIT` is issued. The embedded SQL interface also supports autocommit of transactions (similar to `psql`'s default behavior) via the `-t` command-line option to `ecpg` (see `app-ecpg`) or via the `EXEC SQL SET AUTOCOMMIT TO ON` statement. In autocommit mode, each command is automatically committed unless it is inside an explicit transaction block. This mode can be explicitly turned off using `EXEC SQL SET AUTOCOMMIT TO OFF`.

The following transaction management commands are available: - Commit an in-progress transaction. - Roll back an in-progress transaction. - Prepare the current transaction for two-phase commit. - Commit a transaction that is in prepared state. - Roll back a transaction that is in prepared state. - Enable autocommit mode. - Disable autocommit mode. This is the default.

## Prepared Statements

When the values to be passed to an SQL statement are not known at compile time, or the same statement is going to be used many times, then prepared statements can be useful.

The statement is prepared using the command `PREPARE`. For the values that are not known yet, use the placeholder `?`:

```
EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt1 FROM "SELECT oid, datname FROM pg_database WHERE oid = ?";
```

If a statement returns a single row, the application can call `EXECUTE` after `PREPARE` to execute the statement, supplying the actual values for the placeholders with a `USING` clause:

```
EXEC SQL EXECUTE stmt1 INTO :dboid, :dbname USING 1;
```

If a statement returns multiple rows, the application can use a cursor declared based on the prepared statement. To bind input parameters, the cursor must be opened with a `USING` clause:

```
EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt1 FROM "SELECT oid,datname FROM pg_database WHERE oid > ?";
EXEC SQL DECLARE foo_bar CURSOR FOR stmt1;

/* when end of result set reached, break out of while loop */
EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

EXEC SQL OPEN foo_bar USING 100;
...
while (1)
{
    EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM foo_bar INTO :dboid, :dbname;
    ...
}
EXEC SQL CLOSE foo_bar;
```

When you don't need the prepared statement anymore, you should deallocate it:

```
EXEC SQL DEALLOCATE PREPARE name;
```

For more details about `PREPARE`, see `ecpg-sql-prepare`. Also see `ecpg-dynamic` for more details about using placeholders and input parameters.

## Using Host Variables

In `ecpg-commands` you saw how you can execute SQL statements from an embedded SQL program. Some of those statements only used fixed values and did not provide a way to insert user-supplied values into statements or have the program process the values returned by the query. Those kinds of statements are not really useful in real applications. This section explains in detail how you can pass data between your C program and the embedded SQL statements using a simple mechanism called host variables. In an embedded SQL program we consider the SQL statements to be guests in the C program code which is the host language. Therefore the variables of the C program are called host variables.

Another way to exchange values between PostgreSQL backends and ECPG applications is the use of SQL descriptors, described in `ecpg-descriptors`.

## Overview

Passing data between the C program and the SQL statements is particularly simple in embedded SQL. Instead of having the program paste the data into the statement, which entails various complications, such as properly quoting the value, you can simply write the name of a C variable into the SQL statement, prefixed by a colon. For example:

```
EXEC SQL INSERT INTO sometable VALUES (:v1, 'foo', :v2);
```

This statement refers to two C variables named `v1` and `v2` and also uses a regular SQL string literal, to illustrate that you are not restricted to use one kind of data or the other.

This style of inserting C variables in SQL statements works anywhere a value expression is expected in an SQL statement.

## Declare Sections

To pass data from the program to the database, for example as parameters in a query, or to pass data from the database back to the program, the C variables that are intended to contain this data need to be declared in specially marked sections, so the embedded SQL preprocessor is made aware of them.

This section starts with:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
```

and ends with:

```
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
```

Between those lines, there must be normal C variable declarations, such as:

```
int   x = 4;
char  foo[16], bar[16];
```

As you can see, you can optionally assign an initial value to the variable. The variable's scope is determined by the location of its declaring section within the program. You can also declare variables with the following syntax which implicitly creates a declare section:

```
EXEC SQL int i = 4;
```

You can have as many declare sections in a program as you like.

The declarations are also echoed to the output file as normal C variables, so there's no need to declare them again. Variables that are not intended to be used in SQL commands can be declared normally outside these special sections.

The definition of a structure or union also must be listed inside a `DECLARE` section. Otherwise the preprocessor cannot handle these types since it does not know the definition.

## Retrieving Query Results

Now you should be able to pass data generated by your program into an SQL command. But how do you retrieve the results of a query? For that purpose, embedded SQL provides special variants of the usual commands `SELECT` and `FETCH`. These commands have a special `INTO` clause that specifies which host variables the retrieved values are to be stored in. `SELECT` is used for a query that returns only single row, and `FETCH` is used for a query that returns multiple rows, using a cursor.

Here is an example:

```
/*
 * assume this table:
 * CREATE TABLE test1 (a int, b varchar(50));
 */

EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int v1;
VARCHAR v2;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

 ...

EXEC SQL SELECT a, b INTO :v1, :v2 FROM test;
```

So the `INTO` clause appears between the select list and the `FROM` clause. The number of elements in the select list and the list after `INTO` (also called the target list) must be equal.

Here is an example using the command `FETCH`:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int v1;
VARCHAR v2;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

 ...

EXEC SQL DECLARE foo CURSOR FOR SELECT a, b FROM test;

 ...

do
{
    ...
    EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM foo INTO :v1, :v2;
    ...
} while (...);
```

Here the `INTO` clause appears after all the normal clauses.

## Type Mapping

When ECPG applications exchange values between the PostgreSQL server and the C application, such as when retrieving query results from the server or executing SQL statements with input parameters, the values need to be converted between PostgreSQL data types and host language variable types (C language data types, concretely). One of the main points of ECPG is that it takes care of this automatically in most cases.

In this respect, there are two kinds of data types: Some simple PostgreSQL data types, such as `integer` and `text`, can be read and written by the application directly. Other PostgreSQL data types, such as `timestamp` and `numeric` can only be accessed through special library functions; see `ecpg-special-types`.

`ecpg-datatype-hostvars-table` shows which PostgreSQL data types correspond to which C data types. When you wish to send or receive a value of a given PostgreSQL data type, you should declare a C variable of the corresponding C data type in the declare section.

## Mapping Between PostgreSQL Data Types and C Variable Types

## Handling Character Strings

To handle SQL character string data types, such as `varchar` and `text`, there are two possible ways to declare the host variables.

One way is using `char[]`, an array of `char`, which is the most common way to handle character data in C.

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    char str[50];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
```

Note that you have to take care of the length yourself. If you use this host variable as the target variable of a query which returns a string with more than 49 characters, a buffer overflow occurs.

The other way is using the `VARCHAR` type, which is a special type provided by ECPG. The definition on an array of type `VARCHAR` is converted into a named `struct` for every variable. A declaration like:

```
VARCHAR var[180];
```

is converted into:

```
struct varchar_var { int len; char arr[180]; } var;
```

The member `arr` hosts the string including a terminating zero byte. Thus, to store a string in a `VARCHAR` host variable, the host variable has to be declared with the length including the zero byte terminator. The member `len` holds the length of the string stored in the `arr` without the terminating zero byte. When a host variable is used as input for a query, if `strlen(arr)` and `len` are different, the shorter one is used.

`VARCHAR` can be written in upper or lower case, but not in mixed case.

`char` and `VARCHAR` host variables can also hold values of other SQL types, which will be stored in their string forms.

## Accessing Special Data Types

ECPG contains some special types that help you to interact easily with some special data types from the PostgreSQL server. In particular, it has implemented support for the `numeric`, `decimal`, `date`, `timestamp`, and `interval` types. These data types cannot usefully be mapped to primitive host variable types (such as `int`, `long long int`, or `char[]`), because they have a complex internal structure. Applications deal with these types by declaring host variables in special types and accessing them using functions in the pgtypes library. The pgtypes library, described in detail in `ecpg-pgtypes` contains basic functions to deal with those types, such that you do not need to send a query to the SQL server just for adding an interval to a time stamp for example.

The follow subsections describe these special data types. For more details about pgtypes library functions, see `ecpg-pgtypes`.

## timestamp, date

Here is a pattern for handling `timestamp` variables in the ECPG host application.

First, the program has to include the header file for the `timestamp` type:

```
#include <pgtypes_timestamp.h>
```

Next, declare a host variable as type `timestamp` in the declare section:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
timestamp ts;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
```

And after reading a value into the host variable, process it using pgtypes library functions. In following example, the `timestamp` value is converted into text (ASCII) form with the `PGTYPEStimestamp_to_asc()` function:

```
EXEC SQL SELECT now()::timestamp INTO :ts;

printf("ts = %s\n", PGTYPEStimestamp_to_asc(ts));
```

This example will show some result like following:

```
ts = 2010-06-27 18:03:56.949343
```

In addition, the DATE type can be handled in the same way. The program has to include `pgtypes_date.h`, declare a host variable as the date type and convert a DATE value into a text form using `PGTYPESdate_to_asc()` function. For more details about the pgtypes library functions, see `ecpg-pgtypes`.

## interval

The handling of the `interval` type is also similar to the `timestamp` and `date` types. It is required, however, to allocate memory for an `interval` type value explicitly. In other words, the memory space for the variable has to be allocated in the heap memory, not in the stack memory.

Here is an example program:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pgtypes_interval.h>

int
main(void)
{
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    interval *in;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb;
    EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;

    in = PGTYPESinterval_new();
    EXEC SQL SELECT '1 min'::interval INTO :in;
    printf("interval = %s\n", PGTYPESinterval_to_asc(in));
    PGTYPESinterval_free(in);

    EXEC SQL COMMIT;
    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT ALL;
    return 0;
}
```

## numeric, decimal

The handling of the `numeric` and `decimal` types is similar to the `interval` type: It requires defining a pointer, allocating some memory space on the heap, and accessing the variable using the pgtypes library functions. For more details about the pgtypes library functions, see `ecpg-pgtypes`.

No functions are provided specifically for the `decimal` type. An application has to convert it to a `numeric` variable using a pgtypes library function to do further processing.

Here is an example program handling `numeric` and `decimal` type variables.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pgtypes_numeric.h>

EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP;

int
main(void)
{
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    numeric *num;
    numeric *num2;
    decimal *dec;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb;
    EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;

    num = PGTYPESnumeric_new();
    dec = PGTYPESdecimal_new();

    EXEC SQL SELECT 12.345::numeric(4,2), 23.456::decimal(4,2) INTO :num, :dec;

    printf("numeric = %s\n", PGTYPESnumeric_to_asc(num, 0));
    printf("numeric = %s\n", PGTYPESnumeric_to_asc(num, 1));
    printf("numeric = %s\n", PGTYPESnumeric_to_asc(num, 2));

    /* Convert decimal to numeric to show a decimal value. */
    num2 = PGTYPESnumeric_new();
    PGTYPESnumeric_from_decimal(dec, num2);

    printf("decimal = %s\n", PGTYPESnumeric_to_asc(num2, 0));
    printf("decimal = %s\n", PGTYPESnumeric_to_asc(num2, 1));
    printf("decimal = %s\n", PGTYPESnumeric_to_asc(num2, 2));

    PGTYPESnumeric_free(num2);
    PGTYPESdecimal_free(dec);
    PGTYPESnumeric_free(num);

    EXEC SQL COMMIT;
    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT ALL;
    return 0;
}
```

## bytea

The handling of the `bytea` type is similar to that of `VARCHAR`. The definition on an array of type `bytea` is converted into a named struct for every variable. A declaration like:

```
bytea var[180];
```

is converted into:

```
struct bytea_var { int len; char arr[180]; } var;
```

The member `arr` hosts binary format data. It can also handle `'\0'` as part of data, unlike `VARCHAR`. The data is converted from/to hex format and sent/received by ecpglib.

`bytea` variable can be used only when `guc-bytea-output` is set to `hex`.

## Host Variables with Nonprimitive Types

As a host variable you can also use arrays, typedefs, structs, and pointers.

## Arrays

There are two use cases for arrays as host variables. The first is a way to store some text string in `char[]` or `VARCHAR[]`, as explained in `ecpg-char`. The second use case is to retrieve multiple rows from a query result without using a cursor. Without an array, to process a query result consisting of multiple rows, it is required to use a cursor and the `FETCH` command. But with array host variables, multiple rows can be received at once. The length of the array has to be defined to be able to accommodate all rows, otherwise a buffer overflow will likely occur.

Following example scans the `pg_database` system table and shows all OIDs and names of the available databases:

```
int
main(void)
{
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    int dbid[8];
    char dbname[8][16];
    int i;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

    memset(dbname, 0, sizeof(char)* 16 * 8);
    memset(dbid, 0, sizeof(int) * 8);

    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb;
    EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;

    /* Retrieve multiple rows into arrays at once. */
    EXEC SQL SELECT oid,datname INTO :dbid, :dbname FROM pg_database;

    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++)
        printf("oid=%d, dbname=%s\n", dbid[i], dbname[i]);

    EXEC SQL COMMIT;
    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT ALL;
    return 0;
}
```

This example shows following result. (The exact values depend on local circumstances.)

```
oid=1, dbname=template1
oid=11510, dbname=template0
oid=11511, dbname=postgres
oid=313780, dbname=testdb
oid=0, dbname=
oid=0, dbname=
oid=0, dbname=
```

## Structures

A structure whose member names match the column names of a query result, can be used to retrieve multiple columns at once. The structure enables handling multiple column values in a single host variable.

The following example retrieves OIDs, names, and sizes of the available databases from the `pg_database` system table and using the `pg_database_size()` function. In this example, a structure variable `dbinfo_t` with members whose names match each column in the `SELECT` result is used to retrieve one result row without putting multiple host variables in the `FETCH` statement.

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    typedef struct
    {
       int oid;
       char datname[65];
       long long int size;
    } dbinfo_t;

    dbinfo_t dbval;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

    memset(&dbval, 0, sizeof(dbinfo_t));

    EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT oid, datname, pg_database_size(oid) AS size FROM pg_database;
    EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

    /* when end of result set reached, break out of while loop */
    EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

    while (1)
    {
        /* Fetch multiple columns into one structure. */
        EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :dbval;

        /* Print members of the structure. */
        printf("oid=%d, datname=%s, size=%lld\n", dbval.oid, dbval.datname, dbval.size);
    }

    EXEC SQL CLOSE cur1;
```

This example shows following result. (The exact values depend on local circumstances.)

```
oid=1, datname=template1, size=4324580
oid=11510, datname=template0, size=4243460
oid=11511, datname=postgres, size=4324580
oid=313780, datname=testdb, size=8183012
```

Structure host variables absorb as many columns as the structure as fields. Additional columns can be assigned to other host variables. For example, the above program could also be restructured like this, with the `size` variable outside the structure:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    typedef struct
    {
       int oid;
       char datname[65];
    } dbinfo_t;

    dbinfo_t dbval;
    long long int size;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

    memset(&dbval, 0, sizeof(dbinfo_t));

    EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT oid, datname, pg_database_size(oid) AS size FROM pg_database;
    EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

    /* when end of result set reached, break out of while loop */
    EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

    while (1)
    {
        /* Fetch multiple columns into one structure. */
        EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :dbval, :size;

        /* Print members of the structure. */
        printf("oid=%d, datname=%s, size=%lld\n", dbval.oid, dbval.datname, size);
    }

    EXEC SQL CLOSE cur1;
```

## Typedefs

typedef
in ECPG

Use the `typedef` keyword to map new types to already existing types.

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    typedef char mychartype[40];
    typedef long serial_t;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
```

Note that you could also use:

```
EXEC SQL TYPE serial_t IS long;
```

This declaration does not need to be part of a declare section; that is, you can also write typedefs as normal C statements.

Any word you declare as a `typedef` cannot be used as an SQL keyword in `EXEC SQL` commands later in the same program. For example, this won't work:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    typedef int start;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
...
EXEC SQL START TRANSACTION;
```

ECPG will report a syntax error for `START TRANSACTION`, because it no longer recognizes `START` as an SQL keyword, only as a typedef. (If you have such a conflict, and renaming the typedef seems impractical, you could write the SQL command using dynamic SQL.)

In PostgreSQL releases before v16, use of SQL keywords as typedef names was likely to result in syntax errors associated with use of the typedef itself, rather than use of the name as an SQL keyword. The new behavior is less likely to cause problems when an existing ECPG application is recompiled in a new PostgreSQL release with new keywords.

## Pointers

You can declare pointers to the most common types. Note however that you cannot use pointers as target variables of queries without auto-allocation. See `ecpg-descriptors` for more information on auto-allocation.

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    int   *intp;
    char **charp;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
```

## Handling Nonprimitive SQL Data Types

This section contains information on how to handle nonscalar and user-defined SQL-level data types in ECPG applications. Note that this is distinct from the handling of host variables of nonprimitive types, described in the previous section.

## Arrays

Multi-dimensional SQL-level arrays are not directly supported in ECPG. One-dimensional SQL-level arrays can be mapped into C array host variables and vice-versa. However, when creating a statement ecpg does not know the types of the columns, so that it cannot check if a C array is input into a corresponding SQL-level array. When processing the output of an SQL statement, ecpg has the necessary information and thus checks if both are arrays.

If a query accesses elements of an array separately, then this avoids the use of arrays in ECPG. Then, a host variable with a type that can be mapped to the element type should be used. For example, if a column type is array of `integer`, a host variable of type `int` can be used. Also if the element type is `varchar` or `text`, a host variable of type `char[]` or `VARCHAR[]` can be used.

Here is an example. Assume the following table:

```
CREATE TABLE t3 (
    ii integer[]
);

testdb=> SELECT * FROM t3;
     ii
-------------
 {1,2,3,4,5}
(1 row)
```

The following example program retrieves the 4th element of the array and stores it into a host variable of type `int`:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int ii;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT ii[4] FROM t3;
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

while (1)
{
    EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :ii ;
    printf("ii=%d\n", ii);
}

EXEC SQL CLOSE cur1;
```

This example shows the following result:

```
ii=4
```

To map multiple array elements to the multiple elements in an array type host variables each element of array column and each element of the host variable array have to be managed separately, for example:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int ii_a[8];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT ii[1], ii[2], ii[3], ii[4] FROM t3;
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

while (1)
{
    EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :ii_a[0], :ii_a[1], :ii_a[2], :ii_a[3];
    ...
}
```

Note again that

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int ii_a[8];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT ii FROM t3;
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

while (1)
{
    /* WRONG */
    EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :ii_a;
    ...
}
```

would not work correctly in this case, because you cannot map an array type column to an array host variable directly.

Another workaround is to store arrays in their external string representation in host variables of type `char[]` or `VARCHAR[]`. For more details about this representation, see `arrays-input`. Note that this means that the array cannot be accessed naturally as an array in the host program (without further processing that parses the text representation).

## Composite Types

Composite types are not directly supported in ECPG, but an easy workaround is possible. The available workarounds are similar to the ones described for arrays above: Either access each attribute separately or use the external string representation.

For the following examples, assume the following type and table:

```
CREATE TYPE comp_t AS (intval integer, textval varchar(32));
CREATE TABLE t4 (compval comp_t);
INSERT INTO t4 VALUES ( (256, 'PostgreSQL') );
```

The most obvious solution is to access each attribute separately. The following program retrieves data from the example table by selecting each attribute of the type `comp_t` separately:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int intval;
varchar textval[33];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

/* Put each element of the composite type column in the SELECT list. */
EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT (compval).intval, (compval).textval FROM t4;
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

while (1)
{
    /* Fetch each element of the composite type column into host variables. */
    EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :intval, :textval;

    printf("intval=%d, textval=%s\n", intval, textval.arr);
}

EXEC SQL CLOSE cur1;
```

To enhance this example, the host variables to store values in the `FETCH` command can be gathered into one structure. For more details about the host variable in the structure form, see `ecpg-variables-struct`. To switch to the structure, the example can be modified as below. The two host variables, `intval` and `textval`, become members of the `comp_t` structure, and the structure is specified on the `FETCH` command.

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
typedef struct
{
    int intval;
    varchar textval[33];
} comp_t;

comp_t compval;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

/* Put each element of the composite type column in the SELECT list. */
EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT (compval).intval, (compval).textval FROM t4;
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

while (1)
{
    /* Put all values in the SELECT list into one structure. */
    EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :compval;

    printf("intval=%d, textval=%s\n", compval.intval, compval.textval.arr);
}

EXEC SQL CLOSE cur1;
```

Although a structure is used in the `FETCH` command, the attribute names in the `SELECT` clause are specified one by one. This can be enhanced by using a `*` to ask for all attributes of the composite type value.

```
...
EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT (compval).* FROM t4;
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

while (1)
{
    /* Put all values in the SELECT list into one structure. */
    EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :compval;

    printf("intval=%d, textval=%s\n", compval.intval, compval.textval.arr);
}
...
```

This way, composite types can be mapped into structures almost seamlessly, even though ECPG does not understand the composite type itself.

Finally, it is also possible to store composite type values in their external string representation in host variables of type `char[]` or `VARCHAR[]`. But that way, it is not easily possible to access the fields of the value from the host program.

## User-Defined Base Types

New user-defined base types are not directly supported by ECPG. You can use the external string representation and host variables of type `char[]` or `VARCHAR[]`, and this solution is indeed appropriate and sufficient for many types.

Here is an example using the data type `complex` from the example in `xtypes`. The external string representation of that type is `(%f,%f)`, which is defined in the functions `complex_in()` and `complex_out()` in `xtypes`. The following example inserts the complex type values `(1,1)` and `(3,3)` into the columns `a` and `b`, and select them from the table after that.

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    varchar a[64];
    varchar b[64];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

    EXEC SQL INSERT INTO test_complex VALUES ('(1,1)', '(3,3)');

    EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR SELECT a, b FROM test_complex;
    EXEC SQL OPEN cur1;

    EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

    while (1)
    {
        EXEC SQL FETCH FROM cur1 INTO :a, :b;
        printf("a=%s, b=%s\n", a.arr, b.arr);
    }

    EXEC SQL CLOSE cur1;
```

This example shows following result:

```
a=(1,1), b=(3,3)
```

Another workaround is avoiding the direct use of the user-defined types in ECPG and instead create a function or cast that converts between the user-defined type and a primitive type that ECPG can handle. Note, however, that type casts, especially implicit ones, should be introduced into the type system very carefully.

For example,

```
CREATE FUNCTION create_complex(r double, i double) RETURNS complex
LANGUAGE SQL
IMMUTABLE
AS $$ SELECT $1 * complex '(1,0')' + $2 * complex '(0,1)' $$;
```

After this definition, the following

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
double a, b, c, d;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

a = 1;
b = 2;
c = 3;
d = 4;

EXEC SQL INSERT INTO test_complex VALUES (create_complex(:a, :b), create_complex(:c, :d));
```

has the same effect as

```
EXEC SQL INSERT INTO test_complex VALUES ('(1,2)', '(3,4)');
```

## Indicators

The examples above do not handle null values. In fact, the retrieval examples will raise an error if they fetch a null value from the database. To be able to pass null values to the database or retrieve null values from the database, you need to append a second host variable specification to each host variable that contains data. This second host variable is called the indicator and contains a flag that tells whether the datum is null, in which case the value of the real host variable is ignored. Here is an example that handles the retrieval of null values correctly:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
VARCHAR val;
int val_ind;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION:

 ...

EXEC SQL SELECT b INTO :val :val_ind FROM test1;
```

The indicator variable `val_ind` will be zero if the value was not null, and it will be negative if the value was null. (See `ecpg-oracle-compat` to enable Oracle-specific behavior.)

The indicator has another function: if the indicator value is positive, it means that the value is not null, but it was truncated when it was stored in the host variable.

If the argument `-r no_indicator` is passed to the preprocessor `ecpg`, it works in no-indicator mode. In no-indicator mode, if no indicator variable is specified, null values are signaled (on input and output) for character string types as empty string and for integer types as the lowest possible value for type (for example, `INT_MIN` for `int`).

## Dynamic SQL

In many cases, the particular SQL statements that an application has to execute are known at the time the application is written. In some cases, however, the SQL statements are composed at run time or provided by an external source. In these cases you cannot embed the SQL statements directly into the C source code, but there is a facility that allows you to call arbitrary SQL statements that you provide in a string variable.

## Executing Statements without a Result Set

The simplest way to execute an arbitrary SQL statement is to use the command `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE`. For example:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
const char *stmt = "CREATE TABLE test1 (...);";
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :stmt;
```

`EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` can be used for SQL statements that do not return a result set (e.g., DDL, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). You cannot execute statements that retrieve data (e.g., `SELECT`) this way. The next section describes how to do that.

## Executing a Statement with Input Parameters

A more powerful way to execute arbitrary SQL statements is to prepare them once and execute the prepared statement as often as you like. It is also possible to prepare a generalized version of a statement and then execute specific versions of it by substituting parameters. When preparing the statement, write question marks where you want to substitute parameters later. For example:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
const char *stmt = "INSERT INTO test1 VALUES(?, ?);";
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL PREPARE mystmt FROM :stmt;
 ...
EXEC SQL EXECUTE mystmt USING 42, 'foobar';
```

When you don't need the prepared statement anymore, you should deallocate it:

```
EXEC SQL DEALLOCATE PREPARE name;
```

## Executing a Statement with a Result Set

To execute an SQL statement with a single result row, `EXECUTE` can be used. To save the result, add an `INTO` clause.

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
const char *stmt = "SELECT a, b, c FROM test1 WHERE a > ?";
int v1, v2;
VARCHAR v3[50];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL PREPARE mystmt FROM :stmt;
 ...
EXEC SQL EXECUTE mystmt INTO :v1, :v2, :v3 USING 37;
```

An `EXECUTE` command can have an `INTO` clause, a `USING` clause, both, or neither.

If a query is expected to return more than one result row, a cursor should be used, as in the following example. (See `ecpg-cursors` for more details about the cursor.)

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
char dbaname[128];
char datname[128];
char *stmt = "SELECT u.usename AS dbaname, d.datname "
             "  FROM pg_database d, pg_user u "
             "  WHERE d.datdba = u.usesysid";
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb AS con1 USER testuser;
EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;

EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt1 FROM :stmt;

EXEC SQL DECLARE cursor1 CURSOR FOR stmt1;
EXEC SQL OPEN cursor1;

EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;

while (1)
{
    EXEC SQL FETCH cursor1 INTO :dbaname,:datname;
    printf("dbaname=%s, datname=%s\n", dbaname, datname);
}

EXEC SQL CLOSE cursor1;

EXEC SQL COMMIT;
EXEC SQL DISCONNECT ALL;
```

## pgtypes Library

The pgtypes library maps PostgreSQL database types to C equivalents that can be used in C programs. It also offers functions to do basic calculations with those types within C, i.e., without the help of the PostgreSQL server. See the following example:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
   date date1;
   timestamp ts1, tsout;
   interval iv1;
   char *out;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

PGTYPESdate_today(&date1);
EXEC SQL SELECT started, duration INTO :ts1, :iv1 FROM datetbl WHERE d=:date1;
PGTYPEStimestamp_add_interval(&ts1, &iv1, &tsout);
out = PGTYPEStimestamp_to_asc(&tsout);
printf("Started + duration: %s\n", out);
PGTYPESchar_free(out);
```

## Character Strings

Some functions such as `PGTYPESnumeric_to_asc` return a pointer to a freshly allocated character string. These results should be freed with `PGTYPESchar_free` instead of `free`. (This is important only on Windows, where memory allocation and release sometimes need to be done by the same library.)

## The numeric Type

The numeric type offers to do calculations with arbitrary precision. See `datatype-numeric` for the equivalent type in the PostgreSQL server. Because of the arbitrary precision this variable needs to be able to expand and shrink dynamically. That's why you can only create numeric variables on the heap, by means of the `PGTYPESnumeric_new` and `PGTYPESnumeric_free` functions. The decimal type, which is similar but limited in precision, can be created on the stack as well as on the heap.

The following functions can be used to work with the numeric type: - Request a pointer to a newly allocated numeric variable. ``` numeric *PGTYPESnumeric_new(void); ``` - Free a numeric type, release all of its memory. ``` void PGTYPESnumeric_free(numeric *var); ``` - Parse a numeric type from its string notation. ``` numeric *PGTYPESnumeric_from_asc(char *str, char **endptr); ``` Valid formats are for example: `-2`, `.794`, `+3.44`, `592.49E07` or `-32.84e-4`. If the value could be parsed successfully, a valid pointer is returned, else the NULL pointer. At the moment ECPG always parses the complete string and so it currently does not support to store the address of the first invalid character in `*endptr`. You can safely set `endptr` to NULL. - Returns a pointer to a string allocated by `malloc` that contains the string representation of the numeric type `num`. ``` char *PGTYPESnumeric_to_asc(numeric *num, int dscale); ``` The numeric value will be printed with `dscale` decimal digits, with rounding applied if necessary. The result must be freed with `PGTYPESchar_free()`. - Add two numeric variables into a third one. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_add(numeric *var1, numeric *var2, numeric *result); ``` The function adds the variables `var1` and `var2` into the result variable `result`. The function returns 0 on success and -1 in case of error. - Subtract two numeric variables and return the result in a third one. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_sub(numeric *var1, numeric *var2, numeric *result); ``` The function subtracts the variable `var2` from the variable `var1`. The result of the operation is stored in the variable `result`. The function returns 0 on success and -1 in case of error. - Multiply two numeric variables and return the result in a third one. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_mul(numeric *var1, numeric *var2, numeric *result); ``` The function multiplies the variables `var1` and `var2`. The result of the operation is stored in the variable `result`. The function returns 0 on success and -1 in case of error. - Divide two numeric variables and return the result in a third one. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_div(numeric *var1, numeric *var2, numeric *result); ``` The function divides the variables `var1` by `var2`. The result of the operation is stored in the variable `result`. The function returns 0 on success and -1 in case of error. - Compare two numeric variables. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_cmp(numeric *var1, numeric *var2) ``` This function compares two numeric variables. In case of error, `INT_MAX` is returned. On success, the function returns one of three possible results: - 1, if `var1` is bigger than `var2` - -1, if `var1` is smaller than `var2` - 0, if `var1` and `var2` are equal - Convert an int variable to a numeric variable. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_from_int(signed int int_val, numeric *var); ``` This function accepts a variable of type signed int and stores it in the numeric variable `var`. Upon success, 0 is returned and -1 in case of a failure. - Convert a long int variable to a numeric variable. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_from_long(signed long int long_val, numeric *var); ``` This function accepts a variable of type signed long int and stores it in the numeric variable `var`. Upon success, 0 is returned and -1 in case of a failure. - Copy over one numeric variable into another one. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_copy(numeric *src, numeric *dst); ``` This function copies over the value of the variable that `src` points to into the variable that `dst` points to. It returns 0 on success and -1 if an error occurs. - Convert a variable of type double to a numeric. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_from_double(double d, numeric *dst); ``` This function accepts a variable of type double and stores the result in the variable that `dst` points to. It returns 0 on success and -1 if an error occurs. - Convert a variable of type numeric to double. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_to_double(numeric *nv, double *dp) ``` The function converts the numeric value from the variable that `nv` points to into the double variable that `dp` points to. It returns 0 on success and -1 if an error occurs, including overflow. On overflow, the global variable `errno` will be set to `PGTYPES_NUM_OVERFLOW` additionally. - Convert a variable of type numeric to int. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_to_int(numeric *nv, int *ip); ``` The function converts the numeric value from the variable that `nv` points to into the integer variable that `ip` points to. It returns 0 on success and -1 if an error occurs, including overflow. On overflow, the global variable `errno` will be set to `PGTYPES_NUM_OVERFLOW` additionally. - Convert a variable of type numeric to long. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_to_long(numeric *nv, long *lp); ``` The function converts the numeric value from the variable that `nv` points to into the long integer variable that `lp` points to. It returns 0 on success and -1 if an error occurs, including overflow and underflow. On overflow, the global variable `errno` will be set to `PGTYPES_NUM_OVERFLOW` and on underflow `errno` will be set to `PGTYPES_NUM_UNDERFLOW`. - Convert a variable of type numeric to decimal. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_to_decimal(numeric *src, decimal *dst); ``` The function converts the numeric value from the variable that `src` points to into the decimal variable that `dst` points to. It returns 0 on success and -1 if an error occurs, including overflow. On overflow, the global variable `errno` will be set to `PGTYPES_NUM_OVERFLOW` additionally. - Convert a variable of type decimal to numeric. ``` int PGTYPESnumeric_from_decimal(decimal *src, numeric *dst); ``` The function converts the decimal value from the variable that `src` points to into the numeric variable that `dst` points to. It returns 0 on success and -1 if an error occurs. Since the decimal type is implemented as a limited version of the numeric type, overflow cannot occur with this conversion.

## The date Type

The date type in C enables your programs to deal with data of the SQL type date. See `datatype-datetime` for the equivalent type in the PostgreSQL server.

The following functions can be used to work with the date type: - Extract the date part from a timestamp. ``` date PGTYPESdate_from_timestamp(timestamp dt); ``` The function receives a timestamp as its only argument and returns the extracted date part from this timestamp. - Parse a date from its textual representation. ``` date PGTYPESdate_from_asc(char *str, char **endptr); ``` The function receives a C char* string `str` and a pointer to a C char* string `endptr`. At the moment ECPG always parses the complete string and so it currently does not support to store the address of the first invalid character in `*endptr`. You can safely set `endptr` to NULL. Note that the function always assumes MDY-formatted dates and there is currently no variable to change that within ECPG. `ecpg-pgtypesdate-from-asc-table` shows the allowed input formats. Valid Input Formats for `PGTYPESdate_from_asc` Input Result `January 8, 1999` `January 8, 1999` `1999-01-08` `January 8, 1999` `1/8/1999` `January 8, 1999` `1/18/1999` `January 18, 1999` `01/02/03` `February 1, 2003` `1999-Jan-08` `January 8, 1999` `Jan-08-1999` `January 8, 1999` `08-Jan-1999` `January 8, 1999` `99-Jan-08` `January 8, 1999` `08-Jan-99` `January 8, 1999` `08-Jan-06` `January 8, 2006` `Jan-08-99` `January 8, 1999` `19990108` `ISO 8601; January 8, 1999` `990108` `ISO 8601; January 8, 1999` `1999.008` `year and day of year` `J2451187` `Julian day` `January 8, 99 BC` `year 99 before the Common Era` - Return the textual representation of a date variable. ``` char *PGTYPESdate_to_asc(date dDate); ``` The function receives the date `dDate` as its only parameter. It will output the date in the form `1999-01-18`, i.e., in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format. The result must be freed with `PGTYPESchar_free()`. - Extract the values for the day, the month and the year from a variable of type date. ``` void PGTYPESdate_julmdy(date d, int *mdy); ``` The function receives the date `d` and a pointer to an array of 3 integer values `mdy`. The variable name indicates the sequential order: `mdy[0]` will be set to contain the number of the month, `mdy[1]` will be set to the value of the day and `mdy[2]` will contain the year. - Create a date value from an array of 3 integers that specify the day, the month and the year of the date. ``` void PGTYPESdate_mdyjul(int *mdy, date *jdate); ``` The function receives the array of the 3 integers (`mdy`) as its first argument and as its second argument a pointer to a variable of type date that should hold the result of the operation. - Return a number representing the day of the week for a date value. ``` int PGTYPESdate_dayofweek(date d); ``` The function receives the date variable `d` as its only argument and returns an integer that indicates the day of the week for this date. - 0 - Sunday - 1 - Monday - 2 - Tuesday - 3 - Wednesday - 4 - Thursday - 5 - Friday - 6 - Saturday - Get the current date. ``` void PGTYPESdate_today(date *d); ``` The function receives a pointer to a date variable (`d`) that it sets to the current date. - Convert a variable of type date to its textual representation using a format mask. ``` int PGTYPESdate_fmt_asc(date dDate, char *fmtstring, char *outbuf); ``` The function receives the date to convert (`dDate`), the format mask (`fmtstring`) and the string that will hold the textual representation of the date (`outbuf`). On success, 0 is returned and a negative value if an error occurred. The following literals are the field specifiers you can use: - `dd` - The number of the day of the month. - `mm` - The number of the month of the year. - `yy` - The number of the year as a two digit number. - `yyyy` - The number of the year as a four digit number. - `ddd` - The name of the day (abbreviated). - `mmm` - The name of the month (abbreviated). All other characters are copied 1:1 to the output string. `ecpg-pgtypesdate-fmt-asc-example-table` indicates a few possible formats. This will give you an idea of how to use this function. All output lines are based on the same date: November 23, 1959. Valid Input Formats for `PGTYPESdate_fmt_asc` Format Result `mmddyy` `112359` `ddmmyy` `231159` `yymmdd` `591123` `yy/mm/dd` `59/11/23` `yy mm dd` `59 11 23` `yy.mm.dd` `59.11.23` `.mm.yyyy.dd.` `.11.1959.23.` `mmm. dd, yyyy` `Nov. 23, 1959` `mmm dd yyyy` `Nov 23 1959` `yyyy dd mm` `1959 23 11` `ddd, mmm. dd, yyyy` `Mon, Nov. 23, 1959` `(ddd) mmm. dd, yyyy` `(Mon) Nov. 23, 1959` - Use a format mask to convert a C `char*` string to a value of type date. ``` int PGTYPESdate_defmt_asc(date *d, char *fmt, char *str); ``` The function receives a pointer to the date value that should hold the result of the operation (`d`), the format mask to use for parsing the date (`fmt`) and the C char* string containing the textual representation of the date (`str`). The textual representation is expected to match the format mask. However you do not need to have a 1:1 mapping of the string to the format mask. The function only analyzes the sequential order and looks for the literals `yy` or `yyyy` that indicate the position of the year, `mm` to indicate the position of the month and `dd` to indicate the position of the day. `ecpg-rdefmtdate-example-table` indicates a few possible formats. This will give you an idea of how to use this function.

## The timestamp Type

The timestamp type in C enables your programs to deal with data of the SQL type timestamp. See `datatype-datetime` for the equivalent type in the PostgreSQL server.

The following functions can be used to work with the timestamp type: - Parse a timestamp from its textual representation into a timestamp variable. ``` timestamp PGTYPEStimestamp_from_asc(char *str, char **endptr); ``` The function receives the string to parse (`str`) and a pointer to a C char* (`endptr`). At the moment ECPG always parses the complete string and so it currently does not support to store the address of the first invalid character in `*endptr`. You can safely set `endptr` to NULL. The function returns the parsed timestamp on success. On error, `PGTYPESInvalidTimestamp` is returned and `errno` is set to `PGTYPES_TS_BAD_TIMESTAMP`. See `pgtypesinvalidtimestamp` for important notes on this value. In general, the input string can contain any combination of an allowed date specification, a whitespace character and an allowed time specification. Note that time zones are not supported by ECPG. It can parse them but does not apply any calculation as the PostgreSQL server does for example. Timezone specifiers are silently discarded. `ecpg-pgtypestimestamp-from-asc-example-table` contains a few examples for input strings. Valid Input Formats for `PGTYPEStimestamp_from_asc` Input Result `1999-01-08 04:05:06` `1999-01-08 04:05:06` `January 8 04:05:06 1999 PST` `1999-01-08 04:05:06` `1999-Jan-08 04:05:06.789-8` `1999-01-08 04:05:06.789 (time zone specifier ignored)` `J2451187 04:05-08:00` `1999-01-08 04:05:00 (time zone specifier ignored)` - Converts a date to a C char* string. ``` char *PGTYPEStimestamp_to_asc(timestamp tstamp); ``` The function receives the timestamp `tstamp` as its only argument and returns an allocated string that contains the textual representation of the timestamp. The result must be freed with `PGTYPESchar_free()`. - Retrieve the current timestamp. ``` void PGTYPEStimestamp_current(timestamp *ts); ``` The function retrieves the current timestamp and saves it into the timestamp variable that `ts` points to. - Convert a timestamp variable to a C char* using a format mask. ``` int PGTYPEStimestamp_fmt_asc(timestamp *ts, char *output, int str_len, char *fmtstr); ``` The function receives a pointer to the timestamp to convert as its first argument (`ts`), a pointer to the output buffer (`output`), the maximal length that has been allocated for the output buffer (`str_len`) and the format mask to use for the conversion (`fmtstr`). Upon success, the function returns 0 and a negative value if an error occurred. You can use the following format specifiers for the format mask. The format specifiers are the same ones that are used in the `strftime` function in libc. Any non-format specifier will be copied into the output buffer. - `%A` - is replaced by national representation of the full weekday name. - `%a` - is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated weekday name. - `%B` - is replaced by national representation of the full month name. - `%b` - is replaced by national representation of the abbreviated month name. - `%C` - is replaced by (year / 100) as decimal number; single digits are preceded by a zero. - `%c` - is replaced by national representation of time and date. - `%D` - is equivalent to `%m/%d/%y`. - `%d` - is replaced by the day of the month as a decimal number (01-31). - `%E*` `%O*` - POSIX locale extensions. The sequences `%Ec` `%EC` `%Ex` `%EX` `%Ey` `%EY` `%Od` `%Oe` `%OH` `%OI` `%Om` `%OM` `%OS` `%Ou` `%OU` `%OV` `%Ow` `%OW` `%Oy` are supposed to provide alternative representations. Additionally `%OB` implemented to represent alternative months names (used standalone, without day mentioned). - `%e` - is replaced by the day of month as a decimal number (1-31); single digits are preceded by a blank. - `%F` - is equivalent to `%Y-%m-%d`. - `%G` - is replaced by a year as a decimal number with century. This year is the one that contains the greater part of the week (Monday as the first day of the week). - `%g` - is replaced by the same year as in `%G`, but as a decimal number without century (00-99). - `%H` - is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (00-23). - `%h` - the same as `%b`. - `%I` - is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (01-12). - `%j` - is replaced by the day of the year as a decimal number (001-366). - `%k` - is replaced by the hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (0-23); single digits are preceded by a blank. - `%l` - is replaced by the hour (12-hour clock) as a decimal number (1-12); single digits are preceded by a blank. - `%M` - is replaced by the minute as a decimal number (00-59). - `%m` - is replaced by the month as a decimal number (01-12). - `%n` - is replaced by a newline. - `%O*` - the same as `%E*`. - `%p` - is replaced by national representation of either ante meridiem or post meridiem as appropriate. - `%R` - is equivalent to `%H:%M`. - `%r` - is equivalent to `%I:%M:%S %p`. - `%S` - is replaced by the second as a decimal number (00-60). - `%s` - is replaced by the number of seconds since the Epoch, UTC. - `%T` - is equivalent to `%H:%M:%S` - `%t` - is replaced by a tab. - `%U` - is replaced by the week number of the year (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53). - `%u` - is replaced by the weekday (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (1-7). - `%V` - is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (01-53). If the week containing January 1 has four or more days in the new year, then it is week 1; otherwise it is the last week of the previous year, and the next week is week 1. - `%v` - is equivalent to `%e-%b-%Y`. - `%W` - is replaced by the week number of the year (Monday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (00-53). - `%w` - is replaced by the weekday (Sunday as the first day of the week) as a decimal number (0-6). - `%X` - is replaced by national representation of the time. - `%x` - is replaced by national representation of the date. - `%Y` - is replaced by the year with century as a decimal number. - `%y` - is replaced by the year without century as a decimal number (00-99). - `%Z` - is replaced by the time zone name. - `%z` - is replaced by the time zone offset from UTC; a leading plus sign stands for east of UTC, a minus sign for west of UTC, hours and minutes follow with two digits each and no delimiter between them (common form for [RFC 822](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc822) date headers). - `%+` - is replaced by national representation of the date and time. - `%-*` - GNU libc extension. Do not do any padding when performing numerical outputs. - $_* - GNU libc extension. Explicitly specify space for padding. - `%0*` - GNU libc extension. Explicitly specify zero for padding. - `%%` - is replaced by `%`. - Subtract one timestamp from another one and save the result in a variable of type interval. ``` int PGTYPEStimestamp_sub(timestamp *ts1, timestamp *ts2, interval *iv); ``` The function will subtract the timestamp variable that `ts2` points to from the timestamp variable that `ts1` points to and will store the result in the interval variable that `iv` points to. Upon success, the function returns 0 and a negative value if an error occurred. - Parse a timestamp value from its textual representation using a formatting mask. ``` int PGTYPEStimestamp_defmt_asc(char *str, char *fmt, timestamp *d); ``` The function receives the textual representation of a timestamp in the variable `str` as well as the formatting mask to use in the variable `fmt`. The result will be stored in the variable that `d` points to. If the formatting mask `fmt` is NULL, the function will fall back to the default formatting mask which is `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S`. This is the reverse function to `pgtypestimestampfmtasc`. See the documentation there in order to find out about the possible formatting mask entries. - Add an interval variable to a timestamp variable. ``` int PGTYPEStimestamp_add_interval(timestamp *tin, interval *span, timestamp *tout); ``` The function receives a pointer to a timestamp variable `tin` and a pointer to an interval variable `span`. It adds the interval to the timestamp and saves the resulting timestamp in the variable that `tout` points to. Upon success, the function returns 0 and a negative value if an error occurred. - Subtract an interval variable from a timestamp variable. ``` int PGTYPEStimestamp_sub_interval(timestamp *tin, interval *span, timestamp *tout); ``` The function subtracts the interval variable that `span` points to from the timestamp variable that `tin` points to and saves the result into the variable that `tout` points to. Upon success, the function returns 0 and a negative value if an error occurred.

## The interval Type

The interval type in C enables your programs to deal with data of the SQL type interval. See `datatype-datetime` for the equivalent type in the PostgreSQL server.

The following functions can be used to work with the interval type: - Return a pointer to a newly allocated interval variable. ``` interval *PGTYPESinterval_new(void); ``` - Release the memory of a previously allocated interval variable. ``` void PGTYPESinterval_free(interval *intvl); ``` - Parse an interval from its textual representation. ``` interval *PGTYPESinterval_from_asc(char *str, char **endptr); ``` The function parses the input string `str` and returns a pointer to an allocated interval variable. At the moment ECPG always parses the complete string and so it currently does not support to store the address of the first invalid character in `*endptr`. You can safely set `endptr` to NULL. - Convert a variable of type interval to its textual representation. ``` char *PGTYPESinterval_to_asc(interval *span); ``` The function converts the interval variable that `span` points to into a C char*. The output looks like this example: `@ 1 day 12 hours 59 mins 10 secs`. The result must be freed with `PGTYPESchar_free()`. - Copy a variable of type interval. ``` int PGTYPESinterval_copy(interval *intvlsrc, interval *intvldest); ``` The function copies the interval variable that `intvlsrc` points to into the variable that `intvldest` points to. Note that you need to allocate the memory for the destination variable before.

## The decimal Type

The decimal type is similar to the numeric type. However it is limited to a maximum precision of 30 significant digits. In contrast to the numeric type which can be created on the heap only, the decimal type can be created either on the stack or on the heap (by means of the functions `PGTYPESdecimal_new` and `PGTYPESdecimal_free`). There are a lot of other functions that deal with the decimal type in the Informix compatibility mode described in `ecpg-informix-compat`.

The following functions can be used to work with the decimal type and are not only contained in the `libcompat` library. - Request a pointer to a newly allocated decimal variable. ``` decimal *PGTYPESdecimal_new(void); ``` - Free a decimal type, release all of its memory. ``` void PGTYPESdecimal_free(decimal *var); ```

 

 

 

## errno Values of pgtypeslib

 

- An argument should contain a numeric variable (or point to a numeric variable) but in fact its in-memory representation was invalid. - An overflow occurred. Since the numeric type can deal with almost arbitrary precision, converting a numeric variable into other types might cause overflow. - An underflow occurred. Since the numeric type can deal with almost arbitrary precision, converting a numeric variable into other types might cause underflow. - A division by zero has been attempted. - An invalid date string was passed to the `PGTYPESdate_from_asc` function. - Invalid arguments were passed to the `PGTYPESdate_defmt_asc` function. - An invalid token in the input string was found by the `PGTYPESdate_defmt_asc` function. - An invalid interval string was passed to the `PGTYPESinterval_from_asc` function, or an invalid interval value was passed to the `PGTYPESinterval_to_asc` function. - There was a mismatch in the day/month/year assignment in the `PGTYPESdate_defmt_asc` function. - An invalid day of the month value was found by the `PGTYPESdate_defmt_asc` function. - An invalid month value was found by the `PGTYPESdate_defmt_asc` function. - An invalid timestamp string pass passed to the `PGTYPEStimestamp_from_asc` function, or an invalid timestamp value was passed to the `PGTYPEStimestamp_to_asc` function. - An infinite timestamp value was encountered in a context that cannot handle it.

 

 

 

## Special Constants of pgtypeslib

 

- A value of type timestamp representing an invalid time stamp. This is returned by the function `PGTYPEStimestamp_from_asc` on parse error. Note that due to the internal representation of the `timestamp` data type, `PGTYPESInvalidTimestamp` is also a valid timestamp at the same time. It is set to `1899-12-31 23:59:59`. In order to detect errors, make sure that your application does not only test for `PGTYPESInvalidTimestamp` but also for `errno != 0` after each call to `PGTYPEStimestamp_from_asc`.

 

 

 

 

## Using Descriptor Areas

 

An SQL descriptor area is a more sophisticated method for processing the result of a `SELECT`, `FETCH` or a `DESCRIBE` statement. An SQL descriptor area groups the data of one row of data together with metadata items into one data structure. The metadata is particularly useful when executing dynamic SQL statements, where the nature of the result columns might not be known ahead of time. PostgreSQL provides two ways to use Descriptor Areas: the named SQL Descriptor Areas and the C-structure SQLDAs.

 

 

## Named SQL Descriptor Areas

 

A named SQL descriptor area consists of a header, which contains information concerning the entire descriptor, and one or more item descriptor areas, which basically each describe one column in the result row.

 

Before you can use an SQL descriptor area, you need to allocate one:

```
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR identifier;
```

The identifier serves as the variable name of the descriptor area. When you don't need the descriptor anymore, you should deallocate it:

```
EXEC SQL DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR identifier;
```

 

To use a descriptor area, specify it as the storage target in an `INTO` clause, instead of listing host variables:

```
EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM mycursor INTO SQL DESCRIPTOR mydesc;
```

If the result set is empty, the Descriptor Area will still contain the metadata from the query, i.e., the field names.

 

For not yet executed prepared queries, the `DESCRIBE` statement can be used to get the metadata of the result set:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
char *sql_stmt = "SELECT * FROM table1";
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt1 FROM :sql_stmt;
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE stmt1 INTO SQL DESCRIPTOR mydesc;
```

 

Before PostgreSQL 9.0, the `SQL` keyword was optional, so using `DESCRIPTOR` and `SQL DESCRIPTOR` produced named SQL Descriptor Areas. Now it is mandatory, omitting the `SQL` keyword produces SQLDA Descriptor Areas, see `ecpg-sqlda-descriptors`.

 

In `DESCRIBE` and `FETCH` statements, the `INTO` and `USING` keywords can be used to similarly: they produce the result set and the metadata in a Descriptor Area.

 

Now how do you get the data out of the descriptor area? You can think of the descriptor area as a structure with named fields. To retrieve the value of a field from the header and store it into a host variable, use the following command:

```
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR name :hostvar = field;
```

Currently, there is only one header field defined: `COUNT`, which tells how many item descriptor areas exist (that is, how many columns are contained in the result). The host variable needs to be of an integer type. To get a field from the item descriptor area, use the following command:

```
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR name VALUE num :hostvar = field;
```

`num` can be a literal integer or a host variable containing an integer. Possible fields are: - number of rows in the result set - actual data item (therefore, the data type of this field depends on the query) - When `TYPE` is `9`, `DATETIME_INTERVAL_CODE` will have a value of `1` for `DATE`, `2` for `TIME`, `3` for `TIMESTAMP`, `4` for `TIME WITH TIME ZONE`, or `5` for `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`. - not implemented - the indicator (indicating a null value or a value truncation) - not implemented - length of the datum in characters - name of the column - not implemented - length of the character representation of the datum in bytes - precision (for type `numeric`) - length of the datum in characters - length of the character representation of the datum in bytes - scale (for type `numeric`) - numeric code of the data type of the column

 

In `EXECUTE`, `DECLARE` and `OPEN` statements, the effect of the `INTO` and `USING` keywords are different. A Descriptor Area can also be manually built to provide the input parameters for a query or a cursor and `USING SQL DESCRIPTOR name` is the way to pass the input parameters into a parameterized query. The statement to build a named SQL Descriptor Area is below:

```
EXEC SQL SET DESCRIPTOR name VALUE num field = :hostvar;
```

 

PostgreSQL supports retrieving more that one record in one `FETCH` statement and storing the data in host variables in this case assumes that the variable is an array. E.g.:

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int id[5];
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL FETCH 5 FROM mycursor INTO SQL DESCRIPTOR mydesc;

EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR mydesc VALUE 1 :id = DATA;
```

 

 

 

## SQLDA Descriptor Areas

 

An SQLDA Descriptor Area is a C language structure which can be also used to get the result set and the metadata of a query. One structure stores one record from the result set.

```
EXEC SQL include sqlda.h;
sqlda_t *mysqlda;

EXEC SQL FETCH 3 FROM mycursor INTO DESCRIPTOR mysqlda;
```

Note that the `SQL` keyword is omitted. The paragraphs about the use cases of the `INTO` and `USING` keywords in `ecpg-named-descriptors` also apply here with an addition. In a `DESCRIBE` statement the `DESCRIPTOR` keyword can be completely omitted if the `INTO` keyword is used:

```
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE prepared_statement INTO mysqlda;
```

 
 

The general flow of a program that uses SQLDA is:

 

Prepare a query, and declare a cursor for it.

 

Declare an SQLDA for the result rows.

 

Declare an SQLDA for the input parameters, and initialize them (memory allocation, parameter settings).

 

Open a cursor with the input SQLDA.

 

Fetch rows from the cursor, and store them into an output SQLDA.

 

Read values from the output SQLDA into the host variables (with conversion if necessary).

 

Close the cursor.

 

Free the memory area allocated for the input SQLDA.

 

 

 

## SQLDA Data Structure

 

SQLDA uses three data structure types: `sqlda_t`, `sqlvar_t`, and `struct sqlname`.

 

PostgreSQL's SQLDA has a similar data structure to the one in IBM DB2 Universal Database, so some technical information on DB2's SQLDA could help understanding PostgreSQL's one better.

 

 

## sqlda_t Structure

 

The structure type `sqlda_t` is the type of the actual SQLDA. It holds one record. And two or more `sqlda_t` structures can be connected in a linked list with the pointer in the `desc_next` field, thus representing an ordered collection of rows. So, when two or more rows are fetched, the application can read them by following the `desc_next` pointer in each `sqlda_t` node.

 

The definition of `sqlda_t` is:

```
struct sqlda_struct
{
char sqldaid[8];
long sqldabc;
short sqln;
short sqld;
struct sqlda_struct *desc_next;
struct sqlvar_struct sqlvar[1];
};

typedef struct sqlda_struct sqlda_t;
```

The meaning of the fields is: - It contains the literal string `"SQLDA "`. - It contains the size of the allocated space in bytes. - It contains the number of input parameters for a parameterized query in case it's passed into `OPEN`, `DECLARE` or `EXECUTE` statements using the `USING` keyword. In case it's used as output of `SELECT`, `EXECUTE` or `FETCH` statements, its value is the same as `sqld` statement - It contains the number of fields in a result set. - If the query returns more than one record, multiple linked SQLDA structures are returned, and `desc_next` holds a pointer to the next entry in the list. - This is the array of the columns in the result set.

 

 

 

## sqlvar_t Structure

 

The structure type `sqlvar_t` holds a column value and metadata such as type and length. The definition of the type is:

```
struct sqlvar_struct
{
short sqltype;
short sqllen;
char *sqldata;
short *sqlind;
struct sqlname sqlname;
};

typedef struct sqlvar_struct sqlvar_t;
```

The meaning of the fields is: - Contains the type identifier of the field. For values, see `enum ECPGttype` in `ecpgtype.h`. - Contains the binary length of the field. e.g., 4 bytes for `ECPGt_int`. - Points to the data. The format of the data is described in `ecpg-variables-type-mapping`. - Points to the null indicator. 0 means not null, -1 means null. - The name of the field.

 

 

 

## struct sqlname Structure

 

A `struct sqlname` structure holds a column name. It is used as a member of the `sqlvar_t` structure. The definition of the structure is:

```
#define NAMEDATALEN 64

struct sqlname
{
short length;
char data[NAMEDATALEN];
};
```

The meaning of the fields is: - Contains the length of the field name. - Contains the actual field name.

 

 

 

 

## Retrieving a Result Set Using an SQLDA

 
 

The general steps to retrieve a query result set through an SQLDA are:

 

Declare an `sqlda_t` structure to receive the result set.

 

Execute `FETCH`/`EXECUTE`/`DESCRIBE` commands to process a query specifying the declared SQLDA.

 

Check the number of records in the result set by looking at `sqln`, a member of the `sqlda_t` structure.

 

Get the values of each column from `sqlvar[0]`, `sqlvar[1]`, etc., members of the `sqlda_t` structure.

 

Go to next row (`sqlda_t` structure) by following the `desc_next` pointer, a member of the `sqlda_t` structure.

 

Repeat above as you need.

 

 

Here is an example retrieving a result set through an SQLDA.

 

First, declare a `sqlda_t` structure to receive the result set.

```
sqlda_t *sqlda1;
```

 

Next, specify the SQLDA in a command. This is a `FETCH` command example.

```
EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM cur1 INTO DESCRIPTOR sqlda1;
```

 

Run a loop following the linked list to retrieve the rows.

```
sqlda_t *cur_sqlda;

for (cur_sqlda = sqlda1;
cur_sqlda != NULL;
cur_sqlda = cur_sqlda->desc_next)
{
...
}
```

 

Inside the loop, run another loop to retrieve each column data (`sqlvar_t` structure) of the row.

```
for (i = 0; i sqld; i++)
{
sqlvar_t v = cur_sqlda->sqlvar[i];
char *sqldata = v.sqldata;
short sqllen = v.sqllen;
...
}
```

 

To get a column value, check the `sqltype` value, a member of the `sqlvar_t` structure. Then, switch to an appropriate way, depending on the column type, to copy data from the `sqlvar` field to a host variable.

```
char var_buf[1024];

switch (v.sqltype)
{
case ECPGt_char:
memset(&var_buf, 0, sizeof(var_buf));
memcpy(&var_buf, sqldata, (sizeof(var_buf) sqln = 2; /* number of input variables */
```

 

After memory allocation, store the parameter values into the `sqlvar[]` array. (This is same array used for retrieving column values when the SQLDA is receiving a result set.) In this example, the input parameters are `"postgres"`, having a string type, and `1`, having an integer type.

```
sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqltype = ECPGt_char;
sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqldata = "postgres";
sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqllen = 8;

int intval = 1;
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqltype = ECPGt_int;
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqldata = (char *) intval
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqllen = sizeof(intval);
```

 

By opening a cursor and specifying the SQLDA that was set up beforehand, the input parameters are passed to the prepared statement.

```
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1 USING DESCRIPTOR sqlda2;
```

 

Finally, after using input SQLDAs, the allocated memory space must be freed explicitly, unlike SQLDAs used for receiving query results.

```
free(sqlda2);
```

 

 

 

## A Sample Application Using SQLDA

 

Here is an example program, which describes how to fetch access statistics of the databases, specified by the input parameters, from the system catalogs.

 

This application joins two system tables, pg_database and pg_stat_database on the database OID, and also fetches and shows the database statistics which are retrieved by two input parameters (a database `postgres`, and OID `1`).

 

First, declare an SQLDA for input and an SQLDA for output.

```
EXEC SQL include sqlda.h;

sqlda_t *sqlda1; /* an output descriptor */
sqlda_t *sqlda2; /* an input descriptor */
```

 

Next, connect to the database, prepare a statement, and declare a cursor for the prepared statement.

```
int
main(void)
{
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
char query[1024] = "SELECT d.oid,* FROM pg_database d, pg_stat_database s WHERE d.oid=s.datid AND ( d.datname=? OR d.oid=? )";
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL CONNECT TO testdb AS con1 USER testuser;
EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;

EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt1 FROM :query;
EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR stmt1;
```

 

Next, put some values in the input SQLDA for the input parameters. Allocate memory for the input SQLDA, and set the number of input parameters to `sqln`. Store type, value, and value length into `sqltype`, `sqldata`, and `sqllen` in the `sqlvar` structure.

```
/* Create SQLDA structure for input parameters. */
sqlda2 = (sqlda_t *) malloc(sizeof(sqlda_t) + sizeof(sqlvar_t));
memset(sqlda2, 0, sizeof(sqlda_t) + sizeof(sqlvar_t));
sqlda2->sqln = 2; /* number of input variables */

sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqltype = ECPGt_char;
sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqldata = "postgres";
sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqllen = 8;

intval = 1;
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqltype = ECPGt_int;
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqldata = (char *)intval
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqllen = sizeof(intval);
```

 

After setting up the input SQLDA, open a cursor with the input SQLDA.

```
/* Open a cursor with input parameters. */
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1 USING DESCRIPTOR sqlda2;
```

 

Fetch rows into the output SQLDA from the opened cursor. (Generally, you have to call `FETCH` repeatedly in the loop, to fetch all rows in the result set.)

```
while (1)
{
sqlda_t *cur_sqlda;

/* Assign descriptor to the cursor */
EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM cur1 INTO DESCRIPTOR sqlda1;
```

 

Next, retrieve the fetched records from the SQLDA, by following the linked list of the `sqlda_t` structure.

```
for (cur_sqlda = sqlda1 ;
cur_sqlda != NULL ;
cur_sqlda = cur_sqlda->desc_next)
{
...
```

 

Read each columns in the first record. The number of columns is stored in `sqld`, the actual data of the first column is stored in `sqlvar[0]`, both members of the `sqlda_t` structure.

```
/* Print every column in a row. */
for (i = 0; i sqld; i++)
{
sqlvar_t v = sqlda1->sqlvar[i];
char *sqldata = v.sqldata;
short sqllen = v.sqllen;

strncpy(name_buf, v.sqlname.data, v.sqlname.length);
name_buf[v.sqlname.length] = '\0';
```

 

Now, the column data is stored in the variable `v`. Copy every datum into host variables, looking at `v.sqltype` for the type of the column.

```
switch (v.sqltype) {
int intval;
double doubleval;
unsigned long long int longlongval;

case ECPGt_char:
memset(&var_buf, 0, sizeof(var_buf));
memcpy(&var_buf, sqldata, (sizeof(var_buf)
#include
#include
#include
#include

EXEC SQL include sqlda.h;

sqlda_t *sqlda1; /* descriptor for output */
sqlda_t *sqlda2; /* descriptor for input */

EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO BREAK;
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP;

int
main(void)
{
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
char query[1024] = "SELECT d.oid,* FROM pg_database d, pg_stat_database s WHERE d.oid=s.datid AND ( d.datname=? OR d.oid=? )";

int intval;
unsigned long long int longlongval;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

EXEC SQL CONNECT TO uptimedb AS con1 USER uptime;
EXEC SQL SELECT pg_catalog.set_config('search_path', '', false); EXEC SQL COMMIT;

EXEC SQL PREPARE stmt1 FROM :query;
EXEC SQL DECLARE cur1 CURSOR FOR stmt1;

/* Create an SQLDA structure for an input parameter */
sqlda2 = (sqlda_t *)malloc(sizeof(sqlda_t) + sizeof(sqlvar_t));
memset(sqlda2, 0, sizeof(sqlda_t) + sizeof(sqlvar_t));
sqlda2->sqln = 2; /* a number of input variables */

sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqltype = ECPGt_char;
sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqldata = "postgres";
sqlda2->sqlvar[0].sqllen = 8;

intval = 1;
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqltype = ECPGt_int;
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqldata = (char *) intval
sqlda2->sqlvar[1].sqllen = sizeof(intval);

/* Open a cursor with input parameters. */
EXEC SQL OPEN cur1 USING DESCRIPTOR sqlda2;

while (1)
{
sqlda_t *cur_sqlda;

/* Assign descriptor to the cursor */
EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM cur1 INTO DESCRIPTOR sqlda1;

for (cur_sqlda = sqlda1 ;
cur_sqlda != NULL ;
cur_sqlda = cur_sqlda->desc_next)
{
int i;
char name_buf[1024];
char var_buf[1024];

/* Print every column in a row. */
for (i=0 ; isqld ; i++)
{
sqlvar_t v = cur_sqlda->sqlvar[i];
char *sqldata = v.sqldata;
short sqllen = v.sqllen;

strncpy(name_buf, v.sqlname.data, v.sqlname.length);
name_buf[v.sqlname.length] = '\0';

switch (v.sqltype)
{
case ECPGt_char:
memset(&var_buf, 0, sizeof(var_buf));
memcpy(&var_buf, sqldata, (sizeof(var_buf);
EXEC SQL INCLUDE "filename";
```

The embedded SQL preprocessor will look for a file named `filename.h`, preprocess it, and include it in the resulting C output. Thus, embedded SQL statements in the included file are handled correctly.

 

The `ecpg` preprocessor will search a file at several directories in following order: - current directory - `/usr/local/include` - PostgreSQL include directory, defined at build time (e.g., `/usr/local/pgsql/include`) - `/usr/include` But when `EXEC SQL INCLUDE "filename"` is used, only the current directory is searched.

 

In each directory, the preprocessor will first look for the file name as given, and if not found will append `.h` to the file name and try again (unless the specified file name already has that suffix).

 

Note that `EXEC SQL INCLUDE` is not the same as:

```
#include
```

because this file would not be subject to SQL command preprocessing. Naturally, you can continue to use the C `#include` directive to include other header files.

 

The include file name is case-sensitive, even though the rest of the `EXEC SQL INCLUDE` command follows the normal SQL case-sensitivity rules.

 

 

 

## The define and undef Directives

 

Similar to the directive `#define` that is known from C, embedded SQL has a similar concept:

```
EXEC SQL DEFINE name;
EXEC SQL DEFINE name value;
```

So you can define a name:

```
EXEC SQL DEFINE HAVE_FEATURE;
```

And you can also define constants:

```
EXEC SQL DEFINE MYNUMBER 12;
EXEC SQL DEFINE MYSTRING 'abc';
```

Use `undef` to remove a previous definition:

```
EXEC SQL UNDEF MYNUMBER;
```

 

Of course you can continue to use the C versions `#define` and `#undef` in your embedded SQL program. The difference is where your defined values get evaluated. If you use `EXEC SQL DEFINE` then the `ecpg` preprocessor evaluates the defines and substitutes the values. For example if you write:

```
EXEC SQL DEFINE MYNUMBER 12;
...
EXEC SQL UPDATE Tbl SET col = MYNUMBER;
```

then `ecpg` will already do the substitution and your C compiler will never see any name or identifier `MYNUMBER`. Note that you cannot use `#define` for a constant that you are going to use in an embedded SQL query because in this case the embedded SQL precompiler is not able to see this declaration.

 

If multiple input files are named on the `ecpg` preprocessor's command line, the effects of `EXEC SQL DEFINE` and `EXEC SQL UNDEF` do not carry across files: each file starts with only the symbols defined by `-D` switches on the command line.

 

 

 

## ifdef, ifndef, elif, else, and endif Directives

 

You can use the following directives to compile code sections conditionally: - Checks a `name` and processes subsequent lines if `name` has been defined via `EXEC SQL define name`. - Checks a `name` and processes subsequent lines if `name` has not been defined via `EXEC SQL define name`. - Begins an optional alternative section after an `EXEC SQL ifdef name` or `EXEC SQL ifndef name` directive. Any number of `elif` sections can appear. Lines following an `elif` will be processed if `name` has been defined and no previous section of the same `ifdef`/`ifndef`...`endif` construct has been processed. - Begins an optional, final alternative section after an `EXEC SQL ifdef name` or `EXEC SQL ifndef name` directive. Subsequent lines will be processed if no previous section of the same `ifdef`/`ifndef`...`endif` construct has been processed. - Ends an `ifdef`/`ifndef`...`endif` construct. Subsequent lines are processed normally.

 

`ifdef`/`ifndef`...`endif` constructs can be nested, up to 127 levels deep.

 

This example will compile exactly one of the three `SET TIMEZONE` commands:

```
EXEC SQL ifdef TZVAR;
EXEC SQL SET TIMEZONE TO TZVAR;
EXEC SQL elif TZNAME;
EXEC SQL SET TIMEZONE TO TZNAME;
EXEC SQL else;
EXEC SQL SET TIMEZONE TO 'GMT';
EXEC SQL endif;
```

 

 

 

 

## Processing Embedded SQL Programs

 

Now that you have an idea how to form embedded SQL C programs, you probably want to know how to compile them. Before compiling you run the file through the embedded SQL C preprocessor, which converts the SQL statements you used to special function calls. After compiling, you must link with a special library that contains the needed functions. These functions fetch information from the arguments, perform the SQL command using the `libpq` interface, and put the result in the arguments specified for output.

 

The preprocessor program is called `ecpg` and is included in a normal PostgreSQL installation. Embedded SQL programs are typically named with an extension `.pgc`. If you have a program file called `prog1.pgc`, you can preprocess it by simply calling:

```
ecpg prog1.pgc
```

This will create a file called `prog1.c`. If your input files do not follow the suggested naming pattern, you can specify the output file explicitly using the `-o` option.

 

The preprocessed file can be compiled normally, for example:

```
cc -c prog1.c
```

The generated C source files include header files from the PostgreSQL installation, so if you installed PostgreSQL in a location that is not searched by default, you have to add an option such as `-I/usr/local/pgsql/include` to the compilation command line.

 

To link an embedded SQL program, you need to include the `libecpg` library, like so:

```
cc -o myprog prog1.o prog2.o ... -lecpg
```

Again, you might have to add an option like `-L/usr/local/pgsql/lib` to that command line.

 

You can use `pg_config`pg_configwith ecpg or `pkg-config`pkg-configwith ecpg with package name `libecpg` to get the paths for your installation.

 

If you manage the build process of a larger project using `make`, it might be convenient to include the following implicit rule to your makefiles:

```
ECPG = ecpg

%.c: %.pgc
$(ECPG) $sqlvar[i].sqltype)
{
case SQLINTEGER:
intval = *(int *)sqldata->sqlvar[i].sqldata;
break;
...
}
```
- Pointer to the NULL indicator. If returned by DESCRIBE or FETCH then it's always a valid pointer. If used as input for `EXECUTE ... USING sqlda;` then NULL-pointer value means that the value for this field is non-NULL. Otherwise a valid pointer and `sqlitype` has to be properly set. Example:
 
  ```
  if (*(int2 *)sqldata->sqlvar[i].sqlind != 0)
      printf("value is NULL\n");
  ```
- Name of the field. 0-terminated string.
- Reserved in Informix, value of `libpq-PQfformat` for the field.
- Type of the NULL indicator data. It's always SQLSMINT when returning data from the server. When the `SQLDA` is used for a parameterized query, the data is treated according to the set type.
- Length of the NULL indicator data.
- Extended type of the field, result of `libpq-PQftype`.
- Unused.
- It equals to `sqldata` if `sqllen` is larger than 32kB.

 Example:

```

EXEC SQL INCLUDE sqlda.h; sqlda_t *sqlda; /* This doesn't need to be under embedded DECLARE SECTION */ EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION; char *prep_stmt = "select * from table1"; int i; EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION; ... EXEC SQL PREPARE mystmt FROM :prep_stmt; EXEC SQL DESCRIBE mystmt INTO sqlda; printf("# of fields: %d\n", sqlda->sqld); for (i = 0; i sqld; i++) printf("field %d: \"%s\"\n", sqlda->sqlvar[i]->sqlname); EXEC SQL DECLARE mycursor CURSOR FOR mystmt; EXEC SQL OPEN mycursor; EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND GOTO out; while (1) { EXEC SQL FETCH mycursor USING sqlda; } EXEC SQL CLOSE mycursor; free(sqlda); /* The main structure is all to be free(), * sqlda and sqlda->sqlvar is in one allocated area */ ``` For more information, see the `sqlda.h` header and the `src/interfaces/ecpg/test/compat_informix/sqlda.pgc` regression test.

## Additional Functions

- Add two decimal type values. ``` int decadd(decimal *arg1, decimal *arg2, decimal *sum); ``` The function receives a pointer to the first operand of type decimal (`arg1`), a pointer to the second operand of type decimal (`arg2`) and a pointer to a value of type decimal that will contain the sum (`sum`). On success, the function returns 0. `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_OVERFLOW` is returned in case of overflow and `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_UNDERFLOW` in case of underflow. -1 is returned for other failures and `errno` is set to the respective `errno` number of the pgtypeslib. - Compare two variables of type decimal. ``` int deccmp(decimal *arg1, decimal *arg2); ``` The function receives a pointer to the first decimal value (`arg1`), a pointer to the second decimal value (`arg2`) and returns an integer value that indicates which is the bigger value. - 1, if the value that `arg1` points to is bigger than the value that `var2` points to - -1, if the value that `arg1` points to is smaller than the value that `arg2` points to - 0, if the value that `arg1` points to and the value that `arg2` points to are equal - Copy a decimal value. ``` void deccopy(decimal *src, decimal *target); ``` The function receives a pointer to the decimal value that should be copied as the first argument (`src`) and a pointer to the target structure of type decimal (`target`) as the second argument. - Convert a value from its ASCII representation into a decimal type. ``` int deccvasc(char *cp, int len, decimal *np); ``` The function receives a pointer to string that contains the string representation of the number to be converted (`cp`) as well as its length `len`. `np` is a pointer to the decimal value that saves the result of the operation. Valid formats are for example: `-2`, `.794`, `+3.44`, `592.49E07` or `-32.84e-4`. The function returns 0 on success. If overflow or underflow occurred, `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_OVERFLOW` or `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_UNDERFLOW` is returned. If the ASCII representation could not be parsed, `ECPG_INFORMIX_BAD_NUMERIC` is returned or `ECPG_INFORMIX_BAD_EXPONENT` if this problem occurred while parsing the exponent. - Convert a value of type double to a value of type decimal. ``` int deccvdbl(double dbl, decimal *np); ``` The function receives the variable of type double that should be converted as its first argument (`dbl`). As the second argument (`np`), the function receives a pointer to the decimal variable that should hold the result of the operation. The function returns 0 on success and a negative value if the conversion failed. - Convert a value of type int to a value of type decimal. ``` int deccvint(int in, decimal *np); ``` The function receives the variable of type int that should be converted as its first argument (`in`). As the second argument (`np`), the function receives a pointer to the decimal variable that should hold the result of the operation. The function returns 0 on success and a negative value if the conversion failed. - Convert a value of type long to a value of type decimal. ``` int deccvlong(long lng, decimal *np); ``` The function receives the variable of type long that should be converted as its first argument (`lng`). As the second argument (`np`), the function receives a pointer to the decimal variable that should hold the result of the operation. The function returns 0 on success and a negative value if the conversion failed. - Divide two variables of type decimal. ``` int decdiv(decimal *n1, decimal *n2, decimal *result); ``` The function receives pointers to the variables that are the first (`n1`) and the second (`n2`) operands and calculates `n1`/`n2`. `result` is a pointer to the variable that should hold the result of the operation. On success, 0 is returned and a negative value if the division fails. If overflow or underflow occurred, the function returns `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_OVERFLOW` or `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_UNDERFLOW` respectively. If an attempt to divide by zero is observed, the function returns `ECPG_INFORMIX_DIVIDE_ZERO`. - Multiply two decimal values. ``` int decmul(decimal *n1, decimal *n2, decimal *result); ``` The function receives pointers to the variables that are the first (`n1`) and the second (`n2`) operands and calculates `n1`*`n2`. `result` is a pointer to the variable that should hold the result of the operation. On success, 0 is returned and a negative value if the multiplication fails. If overflow or underflow occurred, the function returns `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_OVERFLOW` or `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_UNDERFLOW` respectively. - Subtract one decimal value from another. ``` int decsub(decimal *n1, decimal *n2, decimal *result); ``` The function receives pointers to the variables that are the first (`n1`) and the second (`n2`) operands and calculates `n1`-`n2`. `result` is a pointer to the variable that should hold the result of the operation. On success, 0 is returned and a negative value if the subtraction fails. If overflow or underflow occurred, the function returns `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_OVERFLOW` or `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_UNDERFLOW` respectively. - Convert a variable of type decimal to its ASCII representation in a C char* string. ``` int dectoasc(decimal *np, char *cp, int len, int right) ``` The function receives a pointer to a variable of type decimal (`np`) that it converts to its textual representation. `cp` is the buffer that should hold the result of the operation. The parameter `right` specifies, how many digits right of the decimal point should be included in the output. The result will be rounded to this number of decimal digits. Setting `right` to -1 indicates that all available decimal digits should be included in the output. If the length of the output buffer, which is indicated by `len` is not sufficient to hold the textual representation including the trailing zero byte, only a single `*` character is stored in the result and -1 is returned. The function returns either -1 if the buffer `cp` was too small or `ECPG_INFORMIX_OUT_OF_MEMORY` if memory was exhausted. - Convert a variable of type decimal to a double. ``` int dectodbl(decimal *np, double *dblp); ``` The function receives a pointer to the decimal value to convert (`np`) and a pointer to the double variable that should hold the result of the operation (`dblp`). On success, 0 is returned and a negative value if the conversion failed. - Convert a variable of type decimal to an integer. ``` int dectoint(decimal *np, int *ip); ``` The function receives a pointer to the decimal value to convert (`np`) and a pointer to the integer variable that should hold the result of the operation (`ip`). On success, 0 is returned and a negative value if the conversion failed. If an overflow occurred, `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_OVERFLOW` is returned. Note that the ECPG implementation differs from the Informix implementation. Informix limits an integer to the range from -32767 to 32767, while the limits in the ECPG implementation depend on the architecture (`INT_MIN .. INT_MAX`). - Convert a variable of type decimal to a long integer. ``` int dectolong(decimal *np, long *lngp); ``` The function receives a pointer to the decimal value to convert (`np`) and a pointer to the long variable that should hold the result of the operation (`lngp`). On success, 0 is returned and a negative value if the conversion failed. If an overflow occurred, `ECPG_INFORMIX_NUM_OVERFLOW` is returned. Note that the ECPG implementation differs from the Informix implementation. Informix limits a long integer to the range from -2,147,483,647 to 2,147,483,647, while the limits in the ECPG implementation depend on the architecture (`-LONG_MAX .. LONG_MAX`). - Converts a date to a C char* string. ``` int rdatestr(date d, char *str); ``` The function receives two arguments, the first one is the date to convert (`d`) and the second one is a pointer to the target string. The output format is always `yyyy-mm-dd`, so you need to allocate at least 11 bytes (including the zero-byte terminator) for the string. The function returns 0 on success and a negative value in case of error. Note that ECPG's implementation differs from the Informix implementation. In Informix the format can be influenced by setting environment variables. In ECPG however, you cannot change the output format. - Parse the textual representation of a date. ``` int rstrdate(char *str, date *d); ``` The function receives the textual representation of the date to convert (`str`) and a pointer to a variable of type date (`d`). This function does not allow you to specify a format mask. It uses the default format mask of Informix which is `mm/dd/yyyy`. Internally, this function is implemented by means of `rdefmtdate`. Therefore, `rstrdate` is not faster and if you have the choice you should opt for `rdefmtdate` which allows you to specify the format mask explicitly. The function returns the same values as `rdefmtdate`. - Get the current date. ``` void rtoday(date *d); ``` The function receives a pointer to a date variable (`d`) that it sets to the current date. Internally this function uses the `pgtypesdatetoday` function. - Extract the values for the day, the month and the year from a variable of type date. ``` int rjulmdy(date d, short mdy[3]); ``` The function receives the date `d` and a pointer to an array of 3 short integer values `mdy`. The variable name indicates the sequential order: `mdy[0]` will be set to contain the number of the month, `mdy[1]` will be set to the value of the day and `mdy[2]` will contain the year. The function always returns 0 at the moment. Internally the function uses the `pgtypesdatejulmdy` function. - Use a format mask to convert a character string to a value of type date. ``` int rdefmtdate(date *d, char *fmt, char *str); ``` The function receives a pointer to the date value that should hold the result of the operation (`d`), the format mask to use for parsing the date (`fmt`) and the C char* string containing the textual representation of the date (`str`). The textual representation is expected to match the format mask. However you do not need to have a 1:1 mapping of the string to the format mask. The function only analyzes the sequential order and looks for the literals `yy` or `yyyy` that indicate the position of the year, `mm` to indicate the position of the month and `dd` to indicate the position of the day. The function returns the following values: - 0 - The function terminated successfully. - `ECPG_INFORMIX_ENOSHORTDATE` - The date does not contain delimiters between day, month and year. In this case the input string must be exactly 6 or 8 bytes long but isn't. - `ECPG_INFORMIX_ENOTDMY` - The format string did not correctly indicate the sequential order of year, month and day. - `ECPG_INFORMIX_BAD_DAY` - The input string does not contain a valid day. - `ECPG_INFORMIX_BAD_MONTH` - The input string does not contain a valid month. - `ECPG_INFORMIX_BAD_YEAR` - The input string does not contain a valid year. Internally this function is implemented to use the `pgtypesdatedefmtasc` function. See the reference there for a table of example input. - Convert a variable of type date to its textual representation using a format mask. ``` int rfmtdate(date d, char *fmt, char *str); ``` The function receives the date to convert (`d`), the format mask (`fmt`) and the string that will hold the textual representation of the date (`str`). On success, 0 is returned and a negative value if an error occurred. Internally this function uses the `pgtypesdatefmtasc` function, see the reference there for examples. - Create a date value from an array of 3 short integers that specify the day, the month and the year of the date. ``` int rmdyjul(short mdy[3], date *d); ``` The function receives the array of the 3 short integers (`mdy`) and a pointer to a variable of type date that should hold the result of the operation. Currently the function returns always 0. Internally the function is implemented to use the function `pgtypesdatemdyjul`. - Return a number representing the day of the week for a date value. ``` int rdayofweek(date d); ``` The function receives the date variable `d` as its only argument and returns an integer that indicates the day of the week for this date. - 0 - Sunday - 1 - Monday - 2 - Tuesday - 3 - Wednesday - 4 - Thursday - 5 - Friday - 6 - Saturday Internally the function is implemented to use the function `pgtypesdatedayofweek`. - Retrieve the current timestamp. ``` void dtcurrent(timestamp *ts); ``` The function retrieves the current timestamp and saves it into the timestamp variable that `ts` points to. - Parses a timestamp from its textual representation into a timestamp variable. ``` int dtcvasc(char *str, timestamp *ts); ``` The function receives the string to parse (`str`) and a pointer to the timestamp variable that should hold the result of the operation (`ts`). The function returns 0 on success and a negative value in case of error. Internally this function uses the `pgtypestimestampfromasc` function. See the reference there for a table with example inputs. - Parses a timestamp from its textual representation using a format mask into a timestamp variable. ``` dtcvfmtasc(char *inbuf, char *fmtstr, timestamp *dtvalue) ``` The function receives the string to parse (`inbuf`), the format mask to use (`fmtstr`) and a pointer to the timestamp variable that should hold the result of the operation (`dtvalue`). This function is implemented by means of the `pgtypestimestampdefmtasc` function. See the documentation there for a list of format specifiers that can be used. The function returns 0 on success and a negative value in case of error. - Subtract one timestamp from another and return a variable of type interval. ``` int dtsub(timestamp *ts1, timestamp *ts2, interval *iv); ``` The function will subtract the timestamp variable that `ts2` points to from the timestamp variable that `ts1` points to and will store the result in the interval variable that `iv` points to. Upon success, the function returns 0 and a negative value if an error occurred. - Convert a timestamp variable to a C char* string. ``` int dttoasc(timestamp *ts, char *output); ``` The function receives a pointer to the timestamp variable to convert (`ts`) and the string that should hold the result of the operation (`output`). It converts `ts` to its textual representation according to the SQL standard, which is be `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. Upon success, the function returns 0 and a negative value if an error occurred. - Convert a timestamp variable to a C char* using a format mask. ``` int dttofmtasc(timestamp *ts, char *output, int str_len, char *fmtstr); ``` The function receives a pointer to the timestamp to convert as its first argument (`ts`), a pointer to the output buffer (`output`), the maximal length that has been allocated for the output buffer (`str_len`) and the format mask to use for the conversion (`fmtstr`). Upon success, the function returns 0 and a negative value if an error occurred. Internally, this function uses the `pgtypestimestampfmtasc` function. See the reference there for information on what format mask specifiers can be used. - Convert an interval variable to a C char* string. ``` int intoasc(interval *i, char *str); ``` The function receives a pointer to the interval variable to convert (`i`) and the string that should hold the result of the operation (`str`). It converts `i` to its textual representation according to the SQL standard, which is be `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. Upon success, the function returns 0 and a negative value if an error occurred. - Convert a long integer value to its textual representation using a format mask. ``` int rfmtlong(long lng_val, char *fmt, char *outbuf); ``` The function receives the long value `lng_val`, the format mask `fmt` and a pointer to the output buffer `outbuf`. It converts the long value according to the format mask to its textual representation. The format mask can be composed of the following format specifying characters: - `*` (asterisk) - if this position would be blank otherwise, fill it with an asterisk. - `&` (ampersand) - if this position would be blank otherwise, fill it with a zero. - `#` - turn leading zeroes into blanks. - ` - `,` (comma) - group numbers of four or more digits into groups of three digits separated by a comma. - `.` (period) - this character separates the whole-number part of the number from the fractional part. - `-` (minus) - the minus sign appears if the number is a negative value. - `+` (plus) - the plus sign appears if the number is a positive value. - `(` - this replaces the minus sign in front of the negative number. The minus sign will not appear. - `)` - this character replaces the minus and is printed behind the negative value. - `$` - the currency symbol. - Convert a string to upper case. ``` void rupshift(char *str); ``` The function receives a pointer to the string and transforms every lower case character to upper case. - Return the number of characters in a string without counting trailing blanks. ``` int byleng(char *str, int len); ``` The function expects a fixed-length string as its first argument (`str`) and its length as its second argument (`len`). It returns the number of significant characters, that is the length of the string without trailing blanks. - Copy a fixed-length string into a null-terminated string. ``` void ldchar(char *src, int len, char *dest); ``` The function receives the fixed-length string to copy (`src`), its length (`len`) and a pointer to the destination memory (`dest`). Note that you need to reserve at least `len+1` bytes for the string that `dest` points to. The function copies at most `len` bytes to the new location (less if the source string has trailing blanks) and adds the null-terminator. - ``` int rgetmsg(int msgnum, char *s, int maxsize); ``` This function exists but is not implemented at the moment! - ``` int rtypalign(int offset, int type); ``` This function exists but is not implemented at the moment! - ``` int rtypmsize(int type, int len); ``` This function exists but is not implemented at the moment! - ``` int rtypwidth(int sqltype, int sqllen); ``` This function exists but is not implemented at the moment! - Set a variable to NULL. ``` int rsetnull(int t, char *ptr); ``` The function receives an integer that indicates the type of the variable and a pointer to the variable itself that is cast to a C char* pointer. The following types exist: - `CCHARTYPE` - For a variable of type `char` or `char*` - `CSHORTTYPE` - For a variable of type `short int` - `CINTTYPE` - For a variable of type `int` - `CBOOLTYPE` - For a variable of type `boolean` - `CFLOATTYPE` - For a variable of type `float` - `CLONGTYPE` - For a variable of type `long` - `CDOUBLETYPE` - For a variable of type `double` - `CDECIMALTYPE` - For a variable of type `decimal` - `CDATETYPE` - For a variable of type `date` - `CDTIMETYPE` - For a variable of type `timestamp` Here is an example of a call to this function: ``` $char c[] = "abc "; $short s = 17; $int i = -74874; rsetnull(CCHARTYPE, (char *) c); rsetnull(CSHORTTYPE, (char *) &s); rsetnull(CINTTYPE, (char *) &i); ``` - Test if a variable is NULL. ``` int risnull(int t, char *ptr); ``` The function receives the type of the variable to test (`t`) as well a pointer to this variable (`ptr`). Note that the latter needs to be cast to a char*. See the function `rsetnull` for a list of possible variable types. Here is an example of how to use this function: ``` $char c[] = "abc "; $short s = 17; $int i = -74874; risnull(CCHARTYPE, (char *) c); risnull(CSHORTTYPE, (char *) &s); risnull(CINTTYPE, (char *) &i); ```

  

  

   

## Additional Constants

   

Note that all constants here describe errors and all of them are defined to represent negative values. In the descriptions of the different constants you can also find the value that the constants represent in the current implementation. However you should not rely on this number. You can however rely on the fact all of them are defined to represent negative values.   - Functions return this value if an overflow occurred in a calculation. Internally it is defined as -1200 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if an underflow occurred in a calculation. Internally it is defined as -1201 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if an attempt to divide by zero is observed. Internally it is defined as -1202 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if a bad value for a year was found while parsing a date. Internally it is defined as -1204 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if a bad value for a month was found while parsing a date. Internally it is defined as -1205 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if a bad value for a day was found while parsing a date. Internally it is defined as -1206 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if a parsing routine needs a short date representation but did not get the date string in the right length. Internally it is defined as -1209 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if an error occurred during date formatting. Internally it is defined as -1210 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if memory was exhausted during their operation. Internally it is defined as -1211 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if a parsing routine was supposed to get a format mask (like `mmddyy`) but not all fields were listed correctly. Internally it is defined as -1212 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value either if a parsing routine cannot parse the textual representation for a numeric value because it contains errors or if a routine cannot complete a calculation involving numeric variables because at least one of the numeric variables is invalid. Internally it is defined as -1213 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if a parsing routine cannot parse an exponent. Internally it is defined as -1216 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if a parsing routine cannot parse a date. Internally it is defined as -1218 (the Informix definition). - Functions return this value if a parsing routine is passed extra characters it cannot parse. Internally it is defined as -1264 (the Informix definition).

  

 

 

  

## Oracle Compatibility Mode

  

`ecpg` can be run in a so-called Oracle compatibility mode. If this mode is active, it tries to behave as if it were Oracle Pro*C.

  

Specifically, this mode changes `ecpg` in three ways:    - Pad character arrays receiving character string types with trailing spaces to the specified length - Zero byte terminate these character arrays, and set the indicator variable if truncation occurs - Set the null indicator to `-1` when character arrays receive empty character string types

 

 

  

## Internals

  

This section explains how `ECPG` works internally. This information can occasionally be useful to help users understand how to use `ECPG`.

   

The first four lines written by `ecpg` to the output are fixed lines. Two are comments and two are include lines necessary to interface to the library. Then the preprocessor reads through the file and writes output. Normally it just echoes everything to the output.

   

When it sees an `EXEC SQL` statement, it intervenes and changes it. The command starts with `EXEC SQL` and ends with `;`. Everything in between is treated as an SQL statement and parsed for variable substitution.

   

Variable substitution occurs when a symbol starts with a colon (`:`). The variable with that name is looked up among the variables that were previously declared within a `EXEC SQL DECLARE` section.

   

The most important function in the library is `ECPGdo`, which takes care of executing most commands. It takes a variable number of arguments. This can easily add up to 50 or so arguments, and we hope this will not be a problem on any platform.

   

The arguments are:    - This is the line number of the original line; used in error messages only. - This is the SQL command that is to be issued. It is modified by the input variables, i.e., the variables that where not known at compile time but are to be entered in the command. Where the variables should go the string contains `?`. - Every input variable causes ten arguments to be created. (See below.) - An `enum` telling that there are no more input variables. - Every output variable causes ten arguments to be created. (See below.) These variables are filled by the function. - An `enum` telling that there are no more variables.

   

For every variable that is part of the SQL command, the function gets ten arguments:    1. The type as a special symbol. 2. A pointer to the value or a pointer to the pointer. 3. The size of the variable if it is a `char` or `varchar`. 4. The number of elements in the array (for array fetches). 5. The offset to the next element in the array (for array fetches). 6. The type of the indicator variable as a special symbol. 7. A pointer to the indicator variable. 8. 0 9. The number of elements in the indicator array (for array fetches). 10. The offset to the next element in the indicator array (for array fetches).

   

Note that not all SQL commands are treated in this way. For instance, an open cursor statement like:

```
EXEC SQL OPEN cursor;
```

is not copied to the output. Instead, the cursor's `DECLARE` command is used at the position of the `OPEN` command because it indeed opens the cursor.

   

Here is a complete example describing the output of the preprocessor of a file `foo.pgc` (details might change with each particular version of the preprocessor):

```
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
int index;
int result;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
...
EXEC SQL SELECT res INTO :result FROM mytable WHERE index = :index;
```

is translated into:

```
/* Processed by ecpg (2.6.0) */
/* These two include files are added by the preprocessor */
#include ;
#include ;

/* exec sql begin declare section */

#line 1 "foo.pgc"

int index;
int result;
/* exec sql end declare section */
...
ECPGdo(__LINE__, NULL, "SELECT res FROM mytable WHERE index = ? ",
ECPGt_int,&(index),1L,1L,sizeof(int),
ECPGt_NO_INDICATOR, NULL , 0L, 0L, 0L, ECPGt_EOIT,
ECPGt_int,&(result),1L,1L,sizeof(int),
ECPGt_NO_INDICATOR, NULL , 0L, 0L, 0L, ECPGt_EORT);
#line 147 "foo.pgc"
```

(The indentation here is added for readability and not something the preprocessor does.)
