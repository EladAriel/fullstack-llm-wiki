title: productionBrowserSourceMaps
description: Enables browser source map generation during the production build.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

Source Maps are enabled by default during development. During production builds, they are disabled to prevent you leaking your source on the client, unless you specifically opt-in with the configuration flag.

Next.js provides a configuration flag you can use to enable browser source map generation during the production build:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  productionBrowserSourceMaps: true,
}
```

When the `productionBrowserSourceMaps` option is enabled, the source maps will be output in the same directory as the JavaScript files. Next.js will automatically serve these files when requested.

- Adding source maps can increase `next build` time
- Increases memory usage during `next build`
