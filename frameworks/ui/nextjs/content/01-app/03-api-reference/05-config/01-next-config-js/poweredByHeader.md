title: poweredByHeader
description: Next.js will add the `x-powered-by` header by default. Learn to opt-out of it here.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

By default Next.js will add the `x-powered-by` header. To opt-out of it, open `next.config.js` and disable the `poweredByHeader` config:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  poweredByHeader: false,
}
```
