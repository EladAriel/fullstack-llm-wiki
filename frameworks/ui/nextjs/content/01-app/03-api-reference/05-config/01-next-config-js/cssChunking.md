title: cssChunking
description: Use the `cssChunking` option to control how CSS files are chunked in your Next.js application.
version: experimental
---

CSS Chunking is a strategy used to improve the performance of your web application by splitting and re-ordering CSS files into chunks. This allows you to load only the CSS that is needed for a specific route, instead of loading all the application's CSS at once.

You can control how CSS files are chunked using the `experimental.cssChunking` option in your `next.config.js` file:

```tsx filename="next.config.ts" switcher
import type { NextConfig } from 'next'

const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    cssChunking: true, // default
  },
} satisfies NextConfig

export default nextConfig
```

```js filename="next.config.js" switcher
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    cssChunking: true, // default
  },
}

module.exports = nextConfig
```

## Options

- **`true` (default)**: Next.js will try to merge CSS files whenever possible, determining explicit and implicit dependencies between files from import order to reduce the number of chunks and therefore the number of requests.
- **`false`**: Next.js will not attempt to merge or re-order your CSS files.
- **`'strict'`**: Next.js will load CSS files in the correct order they are imported into your files, which can lead to more chunks and requests.

You may consider using `'strict'` if you run into unexpected CSS behavior. For example, if you import `a.css` and `b.css` in different files using a different `import` order (`a` before `b`, or `b` before `a`), `true` will merge the files in any order and assume there are no dependencies between them. However, if `b.css` depends on `a.css`, you may want to use `'strict'` to prevent the files from being merged, and instead, load them in the order they are imported - which can result in more chunks and requests.

For most applications, we recommend `true` as it leads to fewer requests and better performance.
