title: compress
description: Next.js provides gzip compression to compress rendered content and static files, it only works with the server target. Learn more about it here.

{/* The content of this doc is shared between the app and pages router. You can use the `<PagesOnly>Content</PagesOnly>` component to add content that is specific to the Pages Router. Any shared content should not be wrapped in a component. */}

By default, Next.js uses `gzip` to compress rendered content and static files when using `next start` or a custom server. This is an optimization for applications that do not have compression configured. If compression is _already_ configured in your application via a custom server, Next.js will not add compression.

You can check if compression is enabled and which algorithm is used by looking at the [`Accept-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) (browser accepted options) and [`Content-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Encoding) (currently used) headers in the response.

## Disabling compression

To disable **compression**, set the `compress` config option to `false`:

```js filename="next.config.js"
module.exports = {
  compress: false,
}
```

We **do not recommend disabling compression** unless you have compression configured on your server, as compression reduces bandwidth usage and improves the performance of your application. For example, you're using [nginx](https://nginx.org/) and want to switch to `brotli`, set the `compress` option to `false` to allow nginx to handle compression.
