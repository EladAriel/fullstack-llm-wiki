title: Invalid ARIA Prop Warning
---

This warning will fire if you attempt to render a DOM element with an `aria-*` prop that does not exist in the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Application (ARIA) [specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#states_and_properties).

1. If you feel that you are using a valid prop, check the spelling carefully. `aria-labelledby` and `aria-activedescendant` are often misspelled.

2. If you wrote `aria-role`, you may have meant `role`.

3. Otherwise, if you're on the latest version of React DOM and verified that you're using a valid property name listed in the ARIA specification, please [report a bug](https://github.com/react/react/issues/new/choose).
