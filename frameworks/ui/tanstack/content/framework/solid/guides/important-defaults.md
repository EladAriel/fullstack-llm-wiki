[//]: # 'StructuralSharing'

- Query results by default are **structurally shared to detect if data has actually changed** and if not, **the data reference remains unchanged** to better help with value stabilization. If this concept sounds foreign, then don't worry about it! 99.9% of the time you will not need to disable this and it makes your app more performant at zero cost to you.
