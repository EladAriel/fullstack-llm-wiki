You can install Solid Query via [NPM](https://npmjs.com/),
or a good ol' `<script>` via
[ESM.sh](https://esm.sh/).

### NPM

```bash
npm i @tanstack/solid-query
```

or

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/solid-query
```

or

```bash
yarn add @tanstack/solid-query
```

or

```bash
bun add @tanstack/solid-query
```

> Wanna give it a spin before you download? Try out the [simple](./examples/simple) or [basic](./examples/basic) examples!

### CDN

If you're not using a module bundler or package manager, you can also use this library via an ESM-compatible CDN such as [ESM.sh](https://esm.sh/). Simply add a `<script type="module">` tag to the bottom of your HTML file:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { QueryClient } from 'https://esm.sh/@tanstack/solid-query'
</script>
```

### Requirements

Solid Query is optimized for modern browsers. It is compatible with the following browsers config

```
Chrome >= 91
Firefox >= 90
Edge >= 91
Safari >= 15
iOS >= 15
Opera >= 77
```

> Depending on your environment, you might need to add polyfills. If you want to support older browsers, you need to transpile the library from `node_modules` yourselves.
