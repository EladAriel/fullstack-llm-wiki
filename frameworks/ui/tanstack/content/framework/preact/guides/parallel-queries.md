[//]: # 'Info'

> When using Preact Query with compat's Suspense, this pattern of parallelism does not work, since the first query would throw a promise internally and would suspend the component before the other queries run. To get around this, you'll either need to use the `useSuspenseQueries` hook (which is suggested) or orchestrate your own parallelism with separate components for each `useSuspenseQuery` instance.
